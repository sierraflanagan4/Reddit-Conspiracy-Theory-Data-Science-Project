1,1,biden,"As you all celebrate or commiserate, please help us out by reporting comments that spread misinformation or incite violence.

A few facts for you all:

* Voter fraud is incredibly rare. The conservative Heritage Foundation [looked for fraud](https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/494649-the-voter-fraud-fraud) over a 36-year period and could only find [1285 cases out of nearly two billion votes cast](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/09/21/voter-fraud-fears-and-mail-worries-grab-headlines-but-the-wait-will-be-the-worry-in-2020/) - a rate of 0.00007%.

* There are election observers in every room where ballots are counted and there are livestreams of most of these counting areas. Yes, this includes Philadelphia, where the Trump Campaign had to [admit in court that they had observers in the room.](https://twitter.com/alanfeuer/status/1324484846857658368)

* Mail-in ballots are legal votes. Those ballots must be cast and post-marked by Election Day. We have been using mail-in ballots since the Civil War, and in 2016, 25% of votes were cast by mail."
2,1,biden,"Congratulations USA! From Brazil, I hope Bolsonaro is the next to fall."
3,1,biden,"Fox News just called it a couple minutes ago, so you know it's real"
4,1,biden,You know its been real when Fox called Arizona before anyone else lol
5,1,biden,"The trumpists are still salty about that, haha."
6,1,biden,Fox News called it almost 20 minutes after everyone else lol
7,1,biden,"True, but they were the *first* outlet to move Joe from 253 up to 264 by calling AZ for Joe, and for the life of me I am unable to deduce why."
8,1,biden,Aren't the people making those decisions fairly independent?
9,1,biden,They are. They're polling is very high quality. Calling Arizona early was kinda irresponsible tho.
10,1,biden,"The ABC in Australia also called it. 

Apparently Fox calling Arizona pissed Trump off to high heavens lol."
11,1,biden,Australia's ahead in time. That's why.
12,1,biden,Jared called to yell at FOX and get them to take it back
13,1,biden,"But they never took it back. The [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-11-05/fox-news-arnon-mishkin-election-2020-arizona-trump-biden) has a pretty good rundown of the nuts and bolts. But even though Fox News decision desk was standing by their call over the past 2 days, they had to be sweating when subsequent Maricopa county numbers were dead on the percentage Trump needed (59%) to make up all the ground. Those numbers have since gone a little more in Biden's favor so it looks like they dodged a bullet."
14,1,biden,First time Fox has been accused of being real.
15,1,biden,"Ive been hopping in and out of r/Conservative all day, shit is HILARIOUS over there. Every other comment is well the republicans wont throw a tantrum for four years like the Dems have

Ok buddy."
16,1,biden,I saw a lot of temper tantrums (and more) when Obama was president.
17,1,biden,"""You were expecting Nevada to decide the election, BUT IT WAS ME, PENNSYLVANIA!"""
18,1,biden,"Trump: HO HO HO, you approach me!

Biden: I can't beat you without getting closer!!"
19,1,biden,Jojo Biden
20,1,biden,Part IV: Donald is Breakable
21,1,biden,Part V: Golden wig
22,1,biden,Im guessing that Trump is a failed reincarnation of Dio
23,1,biden,Or one of his horrible children from Stone Ocean.
24,1,biden,DIOnald Trump
25,1,biden,Joejoe Biden's Bizarre Election
26,1,biden,Good lord someone draw the comic frame with trump as dio and Biden as Jotaro walking up with this line.
27,1,biden,Yeah I'm going to need a link. Thanks.
28,1,biden,"Now I really want Trump to refuse to leave and when they try to drag him out Biden is just like ""Hold on, I'll handle this."" then just woops Trump's ass."
29,1,biden,"Im hoping Nevada finishes counting that one single county by the time Biden is inaugurated.

EDIT:  Biden won Nevada...they finally counted enough votes..."
30,1,biden,"TBF Nevada probably wouldve be called if they didnt call Arizona, which ended up being a bit closer than expected. Pennsylvania meant that Arizona was unnecessary."
31,1,biden,"Everyone is shitting on NV, but if you know that state, you'd know it would go to Biden. Yes, it's a swing state. But it's more liberal every year.

This is the first year for universal mail in, so I'm not too shocked that there was some delays. In the primaries, it was the only time they've done early voting. Huge lines. Because people wanted out of the caucus system.

It's a state that's going through crazy growing pains. But I know without a doubt that Nevada would go blue. 

It's a weird state. Basically it's Vegas to the south. Reno metro to the northern. And then a whole lot of NOTHING. I mean like really really small places. Then the rest is military area.

Vegas will be reliably blue in another cycle or two, due to the Reno area growing so rapidly. Countless numbers of jobs seem to be pouring in. It's literally like 30 minutes from California. Also fun fact: it's further west than LA.

So yeah, this would have been called a day ago if it wasn't for the whole Arizona thing. Nevada would have been called ages ago. 

Everyone just decided to leave it up to PA I think. I don't even think NV is in recount territory is it? It's still a swing state, don't get me wrong. But the trend is pretty clear to anyone from these places."
32,1,biden,ZA WARUDO.... is happy this is finally over!
33,1,biden,https://twitter.com/CopingMAGA/status/1324905662875365380?s=19
34,1,biden,As a NY transplant to southern PA I cant be any more proud to have cast a vote in this election.
35,1,biden,"Trump, you're not the president anymore

YES I AM"

37,1,biden,"A motherducking jojo reference in a history making thread.

Take my upvote.

Edit: my phone autocorrected to ducking. And I'm keeping it."
38,1,biden,Everythings a jojo reference my man
39,1,biden,"Is it 100% confirmed, as in nothing can take this away?"
40,1,biden,"According to the PA election people just now, the outstanding ballots aren't enough to close the gap and the margin is/will be outside the mandatory recount trigger.

So, yes, sort of. There could be legal or extralegal shenanigans that can always happen."
41,1,biden,"&gt;extralegal

Is that just like frivolous lawsuits?"
42,1,biden,"Yes lawsuits, but there are other things that could happen too though. In theory, the PA state legislature could decide to ignore the vote of the people and select whoever they want to be the state's electors who actually vote for the president (they are who we elect when we vote in the election, and it is generally understood that they will vote for who they said they would but they do not always do so). It may sound like a crazy conspiracy theory, but it has been acknowledged as a potential plan by the Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman ([https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/))

Pennsylvania however does not look like it will end up being the pivotal state, and this extraordinary step would have to be taken in multiple states for Trump to win, which imo significantly decreases the likelihood of it occurring."
43,1,biden,I think the speaker of the PA house already said theyre not doing that
44,1,biden,"""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."" Maya Angelou"
45,1,biden,"You're not wrong, but now that Biden is declared president-elect, you can't really put that toothpaste back in the tube. This isn't Bush v Gore. If Trump successfully pulled shenanigans now, his life expectancy would quite dramatically shrink."
46,1,biden,"Yep.

&gt; the Pennsylvania General Assembly does not and will not have a hand in choosing the states presidential electors or in deciding the outcome of the presidential election.

https://www.wfmz.com/news/state/pennsylvania-state-gop-won-t-overrule-popular-vote/article_81b9609a-2728-57e2-b014-d643fdbe1202.html"
47,1,biden,"Not even monumental fraud could change this one. Maybe, just maybe one state but not the three or four trump needs. Florida was famously decided in 2000 by 537 votes and each state this cycle will be 10 times that margin."
48,1,biden,Nothing sums up his Presidency better than the fact Trump was *golfing* when he found out Biden had won >#
49,1,biden,"Youre assuming his aides have drawn straws to tell him already

Edit: typo"
50,1,biden,They made a paper airplane with the news and threw it from a distance.
51,1,biden,"*OK, everybody, raise your hand if you're currently the President of the United States of America and you're heading into your second term.*

*Uh, no, Mr. Trump, please put your hand down, sir...*"
52,1,biden,He can't read though?
53,1,biden,If you write it large enough and in sharpie and it can recognize basic English
54,1,biden,I think at this point it might be better for them to make a replica White House for him to sit in and pretend that he won the election.
55,1,biden,"I seriously think that this might happen.

I think there is a 1/3 chance Trump is going to leave America and set up a ""government in exile"" likely in Russia."
56,1,biden,"From the CNN talking heads - probably intentional.

Imagine if he was in the WH listening to all the cheering of his failure - probably have a heart attack"
57,1,biden,His catchphrase was youre fired and now thats trending on twitter. Full circle indeed
58,1,biden,I beleive its also on signs at the blm protests outsde the white house. Thats gotta sting.
59,1,biden,He's been hiding out at his golf course today.
60,1,biden,I wish we could see a simulation of Obama clobbering Trump head to head in an election. Gives me the same feels as the final scenes of Inglorious Basterds
61,1,biden,Fucking THANK YOU Pennsylvania the wait was driving me insane.
62,1,biden,"I live in Pittsburgh.  Folks are going bananas right now.  Driving around waving American flags, chanting USA, cheering in the streets"
63,1,biden,"Maybe we'll actually reclaim the American flag back as a positive symbol now. For a while now I feel it was hijacked by the right wing, first the Tea Party, then the alt right and Trumpers, to represent only them and their agenda."
64,1,biden,"We drove all over DC today waving a MASSIVE American flag to celebrate, and we got honks and cheers almost nonstop the whole hour or two we were out there. It felt good to reclaim our flag as a symbol of democracy."
65,1,biden,Only been twice but Pittsburgh is such a cool city.
66,1,biden,"It's extremely underrated. And it has a declining population, so now it's a great time to move there if you're in the mood!"
67,1,biden,"I didn't even need to check to know because NYC was cheering/ screaming/ honking haha

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Unfortunately, I didn't take any videos. There are a lot on /r/nyc (sort by new too) though!"
68,1,biden,That happened outside my window and my roommate was like no way the two are connected
69,1,biden,"I thought there was a marathon I wasnt aware of, as it usually goes right in front of my apartment."
70,1,biden,"Satisfaction, contentment, relief and peaceful happiness in my street

Prolly a bit of alcohol and dancing later"
71,1,biden,Longest ultra-marathon ever. Took 4 years to finish.
72,1,biden,"Same. Found out in Chicago because the streets were suddenly swarmed with people cheering, honking, banging pots and pans."
73,1,biden,"I literally turned to my gf and said ""there's a race going on outside!"" I now feel very dumb."
74,1,biden,...race to the White House.
75,1,biden,"Grew up in NYC, and our household is planning to move back there when we can save up enough to buy a house, but stuck in heehaw territory here in Indiana for the moment. Instead of celebration, I get someone I know who's talking about going out and killing Democrats because they support the overthrow of the American government."
76,1,biden,Report them. There is a non-zero chance they could.
77,1,biden,"I'm in Ohio.  I haven't heard anything, but I've noticed a few people quietly took down their trump signs. ="
78,1,biden,"Yes! I'm visiting a friend in nyc, and honestly thought there was something going on we didn't know about. We came out of the subway system to cheers and honks. It was the most united I've felt citizens being in a long time."
79,1,biden,The whole world is rejoicing. The nation with the most powerful military in the world has saved itself from a fascist dictatorship. Thanking god today!
80,1,biden,"State governments around the country deserve so much praise. They have run honest, transparent elections, resisting an unprecedented effort from the president to undermine the election, all of this being done during a global health crisis. Republican and Democratic state governments alike are the real MVPs for me."
81,1,biden,"He's still going to try, but he's fucked. Bye,  clown"
82,1,biden,"The amount of cheering, car honking, and claps here in NYC is breathtaking!!!!! Congratulations!"
83,1,biden,"I live in a town in Maryland full of old hippy types. Theres a celebratory drum circle happening, lol."
84,1,biden,"Same in DC! Everyone is cheering,  honking, and smiling at each other. It feels so good to see this many people happy and united by something good"
85,1,biden,Same here in Philly! Theres a bunch of spontaneous block parties. THE GANG SAVES DEMOCRACY!!!
86,1,biden,"Quiet Seattle neighborhoods overwhelmed by honking and people yelling ""Biden got the win"" from porches at 8:30 in the morning. I love it."
87,1,biden,And here I am sitting alone in Alabama.
88,1,biden,Drinking champagne alone in my living room while watching other people celebrate.
89,1,biden,My friend just called me from brooklyn and put me on speaker phone. I cried.
90,1,biden,"I love how its more celebrating, cheering and drinks being poured, and less rioting and  protesting from trump supporters who were threatening violence and unrest if trump lost."
91,1,biden,"Well, its NYC. Im sure the Trump people will be butthurt elsewhere"
92,1,biden,"They don't have the cohesion to riot. Their play will be acts of terrorism. Shootings, foiled and successful assassination plots, Maybe a bombing. Stuff that solo extremists and small groups can do."
93,1,biden,Trump is fuming on twitter #youarefired trending
94,1,biden,"Trump: Joe, you cant just declare yourself President-Elect.



Joe.   : When you win the Electoral College, they let you do it."
95,1,biden,"When you grab them by the Electoral votes, they let you do it"
96,1,biden,"My neighbor had a yard sign that read, ""Grab him by the ballot!"""
97,1,biden,"My fave was one that read "" end of an error """
98,1,biden,"
&gt; Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump
&gt; 2h
&gt; I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!

Looking at the electoral votes: 290 vs 214 for Biden

Looking at the popular vote: 74,857,880 (50.6%) vs 70,598,535 (47.7%) for Biden"
99,1,biden,I guess math was never his strong point.
100,1,biden,It's the same delusional state he has been in for the last four years.
101,1,biden,"I can't help but be sad that 70+ million people saw that man and said ""yep, that's what I want right there""."
102,1,biden,"im so pumped for this incoming meltdown, the most exciting thing in this presidency."
103,1,biden,"It's like the bad guy raging at the end of a movie, shits incredible."
104,1,biden,"And I would have gotten away with it, if it werent for the millions of votes cast against me"
105,1,biden,Trump's twitter account page is about to get more views more quickly than anything else in history just from people refreshing to see how batshit the temper tantrum will be.
106,1,biden,"Hey Donald, youre fired.

-America"
107,1,biden,"As a Canadian, I am happy for our neighbours."
108,1,biden,"As a Canadian, I'm so thankful to our neighbours. We're exhausted of watching this shit show from a far. Can we soon turn on our TV and stop hearing about this asshole already?"
109,1,biden,"Hopefully, but remember there are 69 million people who voted for four more years of it, so expect some kind of Tea Party 2.0, or 2020 edition."
110,1,biden,As a Canadian in Michigan...freaking relieved. My American wife wept for 15 minutes. That is how bad it's been.
111,1,biden,"As a Frenchman, it's like having your old friend recovering from addiction. As the mayor of Paris just said, ""Welcome back America"""
112,1,biden,"I lost my mom to covid last night. Watching Donald ripped from the white house and torn apart by lawsuits and investigations screaming and failing the entire time, while it won't fill the void of my loss, it will surely help in the grieving process."
113,1,biden,I'm sorry for your loss xx
114,1,biden,"Thank you I appreciate it. Seeing reports of biden creating a new covid task force, i couldn't help but think ""heh, not a moment too soon"" ="
115,1,biden,And Trump is playing golf when the announcement was made. How fitting!
116,1,biden,CBS just said it's his 209th golf outing since he was sworn in.
117,1,biden,"He still has these two months before Biden is sworn in, right?"
118,1,biden,I think it's lame duck
119,1,biden,"Actually, sitting duck is fairly appropriate."
120,1,biden,Obama golfed I believe 330~ times. So he'd need to average a little over a round a day until inauguration. This is the only time i've had faith in Trumps ability.
121,1,biden,It should be worth mentioning that Obamas golfing was primarily done on military base courses and not Trumps own courses.
122,1,biden,"Just out of curiosity, how many of those golf trips were taken at his own personal properties?  And how much did each of those trips cost American taxpayers?  I know there's a redditor out there that can run the math on this.

I guess what I'm wondering is how much of the US Treasury Trump funneled into his own pockets by playing a lot of golf?"
123,1,biden,How iconic
124,1,biden,Par for the course
125,1,biden,"He was elected to play golf and rage-tweet, wasn't he?"
126,1,biden,"I live in PA, and have never voted for a Democrat before. I'm so glad I did this time."
127,1,biden,"Same here but in GA! As someone who leans conservative, the words the Lincoln Project guys ring true with me; with Joe Biden, there will be disagreements, but at least we can have HAVE a disagreement!

Happy to have a president who will work for every citizen!"
128,1,biden,"Congrats on being part of history, too - you helped flip GA blue for the first time in like 3 decades.

I look forward to disagreeing and (hopefully) still finding workable solutions with Republicans who aren't all about ""owning the libs"" at all cost. Assuming our surrogates allow us to."
129,1,biden,Stacy Abrams is a real life Captain America. She saved the country. I love her so much.
130,1,biden,"As a liberal, I look forward to getting people like mccain back on the ticket for you to get a chance to vote for someone like him in the future."
131,1,biden,"THANK YOU! As a fellow PA native, Im so proud :) thank you thank you thank you."
132,1,biden,I'm just grateful and relieved to see the little blue state on the map haha
133,1,biden,"Us, too!! If you come to Oregon, we'll get you a free beer!"
134,1,biden,"Trump will finally know what this year has been like for the rest of us... He's broke, losing his job, and about to be evicted."
135,1,biden,"Broke, losing his job with eviction looming *and* he contracted COVID. Hes having the full 2020 civilian experience!"
136,1,biden,Truly a man of the people
137,1,biden,"Trump will never be in the position over 92% of Americans are in. 

Born into wealth and will die with wealth.

Still, your comment is fun"
138,1,biden,Now lets fix the system before a competent fascist actually does takeover! The unwritten rules have to be actual rules.
139,1,biden,"This. It's obvious a more devious, clever president can do a lot of destruction to gain whatever he's after."
140,1,biden,"This. So much this. There needs to be more checks and balances and accountability.

And a better impeachment process.

And people in power who believe in democracy at all costs, not people who want to stick it to the other party at all costs attitude."
141,1,biden,"This is the most underrated comment here. =Ø agreed. Also, Congress term limits jfc."
142,1,biden,"People are cheering across the rooftops here in NYC. It's the best feeling since March to hear a city celebrate and not just survive

Edit: Very happy to hear about everyone else's city erupting too. Can report from a friend that Mill Valley (north of SF) is also rocking at the moment

Second Edit: Sorry, I didn't think to take a video. I put down my phone pretty early on as I wanted to clap as much as possible -- anyway, a video from my perspective would just be hearing me hollering like an idiot. Big shout out to the pot banging family on the other side of Broadway who waved back and danced with us! Lastly, for those who cannot celebrate out in the streets for whatever reason, you're welcome to the party in this thread. I have family in law that are in a similar situation so they've mostly plopped down with a big fry up breakfast!

Third Edit: Thank you very much for my first reddit awards. I'd give the spiel about money being better used elsewhere but I am going to pretend that these are the free gifts that reddit keeps trying to hook people with. Big shout out to u/leaveittobever who came in clutch with the video from Chicago! It's basically what my experience was but with a better view and less pots and pans. Can't thank everyone enough for all the wonderful replies about their cities -- a nice reminder of what social media was supposed to and can still be. Y'all have made my day twice as nice"
143,1,biden,the goosebumps
144,1,biden,I flew straight past goosebumps and am full on happy ugly crying
145,1,biden,"oh, sorry, I didn't put it into context, I'm from Italy and I got goosebumps xD  


  
(Had I been living in a USA city I'd probably be part of the screaming outsides)"
146,1,biden,"Im in the U.K. and the videos of cities erupting into celebration is making me want to cry for you guys

Edit: happy cry"
147,1,biden,Thanks for sharing! I can't wait for someone to post a compilation video. It's so uplifting to hear those cheers!
148,1,biden,"It would look like the ending to Return of the Jedi, lol."
149,1,biden,Youve got a gorgeous view there
150,1,biden,We had a smallish parade drive by honking and holding Biden Harris signs and people came out and started clapping in a Chicago suburb. It felt nice to feel the joy
151,1,biden,Same here in Philly. I dont think Ive felt such wholesome good vibes in this city.
152,1,biden,DC is absolutely bonkers with joy right now. It's an amazing feeling
153,1,biden,"It's dead fucking quiet in Springfield Ohio

But that's normal"
154,1,biden,"Same here. Majors cities are blue, but I'm out too far to enjoy the party. Makes me happy to think about all the people who were part of the trump parade around 270 finally seeing this in black and white. I'd probably be shot by an angry redneck if I tried to cheer around here."
155,1,biden,"We had like one truck of people cheering and driving around town with a Biden flag in Spartanburg, SC."
156,1,biden,"I remember looking at one of the election maps and seeing that over 90% of DC voted for Biden, I was absolutely shocked. Y'all really hate this mf, I love to see it"
157,1,biden,Its like the end of Return of the Jedi
158,1,biden,Checking in from Chicago. The city has lost it's collective freaking mind right now.
159,1,biden,"And Trump was calling New York his city and saying it was a ghost town, hilarious that his ass whooping brought it back to life"
160,1,biden,People are in the streets screaming here in sf
161,1,biden,I'm in the heart of Castro district in SF. Goodbye sleep.
162,1,biden,"In sf and Im hearing a lot of Queen, the national anthem, and some drum/didgeridoo circles"
163,1,biden,"Trump's opinions will be completely irrelevant now, that's so beautiful"
164,1,biden,I think he is still going to have a big following
165,1,biden,"Yeah but now they'll just be idiots following a former defamed president, not a current acting defamed president"
166,1,biden,He's going to be a laughing stock quick enough when his crimes are properly investigated.
167,1,biden,We're about to witness the biggest adult temper tantrum in history.
168,1,biden,"https://imgur.com/hE3v9OZ.gifv


Pretty much  :)"
169,1,biden,That might be one of the best things I've seen in months
170,1,biden,"Holy shit, what is this from?"
171,1,biden,The whitehouse
172,1,biden,I'm glad I wasn't drinking my coffee.
173,1,biden,"https://youtu.be/Th5uVIhQ8VY 

I miss The President Show."
174,1,biden,"I was just looking for the President Show clip of Trump in his desk chair being wheeled out of the White House, kicking and screaming, into the back of a moving van.


(Btw, I think Anthony Atamanuik's Trump is miles ahead of Alec Baldwin's. Atamanuik has the body language, gestures, and voice down pat, while Baldwin's impression is 90%  hair, makeup, and pursed lips.)"
175,1,biden,A tantrump.
176,1,biden,Nixon's legacy was Watergate. Trump's legacy will be Babygate
177,1,biden,Can't wait for inauguration day when they have to drag the big man baby out of the White House bunker.
178,1,biden,hope he puts on a fight and trips on his way out for maximum humiliation.
179,1,biden,"I'm hope he resists, and gets dragged out, v preferable if he's arrested to be sent to NY to jail.."
180,1,biden,"I dunno, I'm expecting him to defect to Russia before the inauguration to avoid any legal difficulties."
181,1,biden,I kinda expect him to now go into crazy psycho exgirlfriend mode and like try to get us fired and slash our tires...maybe start a few rumors about how abusive we were.
182,1,biden,White smoke coming from AP HQ. Habemus praesides.
183,1,biden,**habemus praesidem*
184,1,biden,Thank you
185,1,biden,*Thankem yous
186,1,biden,Where I am at the sun just came out for the first time in weeks.
187,1,biden,Praise the sun \\\[T\]/
188,1,biden,We've done it brother! \ [T] /
189,1,biden,Finally a good day for America.
190,1,biden,As a Georgia voter.  I truly feel like my vote made a difference this time.
191,1,biden,"Also a Georgia voter. Same. 

But the work's not done. We can't Falcons this in the run-offs."
192,1,biden,Or Braves it. Blowing leads seem to be  persistent issue for us =
193,1,biden,"Since this is new territory for us, maybe we'll Atlanta United it? Not this year's AUFC though."
194,1,biden,"Dont let it get you down. As a Saints fan, this is my first time rooting for an Atlanta comeback! Go get em and do us all proud!"
195,1,biden,Thank you for voting! I hope going forward we all realize how important voting is and keep at it.
196,1,biden,"I wish everyone understood how important the smaller, local races are."
197,1,biden,As a Florida voter I'm embarrassed Georgia is now more progressive than Florida.
198,1,biden,"I was surprised by Florida. The battle ground states of the bush years (OH, FL) are now solid red it seems, but AZ, GA and a couple others are the battlegrounds now. Pretty interesting."
199,1,biden,It wasn't even that far back. Florida and Ohio both went to Obama twice.
200,1,biden,"Obama was an outlier candidate, in my opinion, and masked trends in the electorate that have been going on since Bill Clintons first run."
201,1,biden,"Dems didnt want FL as bad as the GOP. Trump spent his last days in FL because without FL his chance to win drops close to 0%. Biden spent his in PA and the rust belt which would give him 90%+ chance of winning, and that paid off since he won through that."
202,1,biden,Texas as a battle ground is incredible
203,1,biden,Same here in AZ. For once I feel like my vote mattered. Im so glad GA flipped as well.
204,1,biden,"Az here. > blue, legalized marijuana for rec use, and the tax on 250k incomes for education? Couldnt be happier."
205,1,biden,Your work is not yet done. The two runoff elections for Senate will determine whether Biden can get anything done for the next four years. No exaggeration.
206,1,biden,Thank you Philadelphia and Atlanta for saving the fucking country
207,1,biden,Georgia is blue thanks to Stacey Abrams and her organization Fair Fight!
208,1,biden,"Donate to her organization!! We need to take back the senate in January with the TWO senate run off races. 

Talk about it to family and friends, get the message out there. We need to win.

Edit: link for those of you interested in learning more and/or donating
https://fairfight.com/"
209,1,biden,I can't afford to donate but I signed up to volunteer!!! Helping any way I can!
210,1,biden,Thats even better dude time is worth so much more than money! Hell yeah!
211,1,biden,And Detroit.  Cant wait to visit.
212,1,biden,"Philadelphia is the same as last election, including in turnout.
Gotta thank all the democrats in the red counties who turned out."
213,1,biden,"And Pittsburg, Madison, and Detroit."
214,1,biden,"Not to be a downer on Pennsylvania or Georgia but just because those states took the longest to count their votes and ended up being the ones to put Biden over the edge, that doesn't meant they were any more important than any other state that voted blue. Any state could have been the one to tip the scale.

Everyone who voted for Biden is responsible"
215,1,biden,Stacy Abrams more specifically
216,1,biden,"Cool, now the real work starts."
217,1,biden,"The majority republican senate: ""No"""
218,1,biden,Mitch McConnell refuses every single piece of legislation presented over the next 4 years.
219,1,biden,Biden needs to get with the times.  Blast that all over the news and all over social media.  Hold more SOUs and say exactly why his plans arent  getting passed.
220,1,biden,Thus exactly. Put forth legislation and every time it isnt even voted on it needs to be blasted as to who and why is blocking it. Make it well known and put as much pressure on McConnell as possibkr
221,1,biden,"the ppl who really need to know the truth wouldnt care, theyd just think biden is bullying all the republicans"
222,1,biden,It doesnt matter if those people dont listen. The MAGA cult wont listen of course. But the people that are fringe voters that think things wont change regardless will hear it and they should hear it in hopes that it shows them WHY things arent being done so when it does come time to take the senate they know its just as important as the presidency.
223,1,biden,"Yes, this.  The obstruction by the senate and subsequent blame by Republicans that Dems couldn't get anything done will be their campaign theme for 2024."
224,1,biden,"Low chance dems control it this year, higher chance they control it in 2022. 21 of the 34 seats are republicans"
225,1,biden,"We have a lot of work to do in convincing voters. With less laws being passed, lots of people might vote less blue because of the lack of progress. People turn without a thought in two years if something isnt changing. 

The other factor is swaying the same never trumpers to keep on when they probably voted red for their senate elections. Lots of things to be done but for now we celebrate!"
226,1,biden,"I will say one amazing thing about the Republican Party is that they have a considerable number of people who go and vote straight R in EVERY election. Democrats seem to only come out for presidential elections.

This gives Republicans control from your local judge up to Senate. And Id say thats even more valuable than losing a few presidential elections."
227,1,biden,Plus statistically people vote against the sitting presidents' party in midterms.
228,1,biden,"Remember, a lot of the stuff Trump did was done by executive order, those can be relatively easily reversed, and the institutional knowledge of most government departments can all be preserved."
229,1,biden,"And a lot of the stuff undone by the Republican Congress was accomplished via the CRA, which bans the reimplementation of those same regulations FOREVER

Edit: I'm getting questions about it, so I'm going to copy paste my response here

&gt;The CRA is the [Congressional Review Act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Review_Act?wprov=sfla1)
&gt;
&gt;Basically, the Republican Congress used the CRA to repeal many regulations. Regulations repealed under the CRA can't be reintroduced ever unless the entire CRA is repealed."
230,1,biden,CRA requires both house and senate to overturn regulations. We still have the house. Biden is free to regulate under existing legislation
231,1,biden,"Right, but I'm talking about regulations that were already repealed via the CRA during Republican control of Congress. We can't even reintroduce those regulations unless we repeal the CRA. Booker has sponsored a bill to do so, but we'd need control of the House and Senate AND would have to repeal the legislative filibuster to repeal the CRA."
232,1,biden,Probably. But mayyybe GAs run off in January may tie the Senate?
233,1,biden,Yeah that run off is going to be historic. Come on Georgia lets ring in 2021 with 2 new senators!
234,1,biden,"Imagine McConnell having to deal with Kamala Harris breaking every tie in the Senate, and relish the idea"
235,1,biden,"While i would absolutely love that, Their is a higher chance a few dems will defect over any issue they have, as each one will have the power to end a bill.  Dems will often not work in lockstep the same way republicans have."
236,1,biden,Theres a lot of people here who werent paying attention during the Obama administration. McConnells a sniper the way he can pick off Dems
237,1,biden,I'm mad about how right you are.
238,1,biden,So much of the next 2-4 years depends on the run-off senate races in Georgia now.
239,1,biden,"I live in GA. I had been getting so many political ads in the mail. On Election day I said ""man, I can finally stop getting an inch of mail a week"". I was wrong.

I think Osoff and Warnock have a chance, but I do call them the underdogs.

This race is gonna come down to which party is more motivated. I'm worried Trump fans will be upset he lost and go vote, and I'm worried too many democrats will think they elected Biden and their job is done. We'll see. I think this is gonna be the most unique run off ever.

Usually runoffs have lower turnout. I think we might see even more votes. I think Obama is gonna move to Georgia for the next 2 months. Lindsey Graham vs Jamie Harrison had a combined total of a little more than 230 million dollars. For these runoffs I wouldn't be surprised if we saw 400 mil dropped into the state. I think this is gonna be the craziest election cycle ever."
240,1,biden,"I'm sure Trump will now realise he's lost, and graciously step down!"
241,1,biden,Fox News and the rest of Murdoch's media is [asking him to do exactly that](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/07/rupert-murdoch-owned-us-outlets-turn-on-trump-urging-him-to-concede-with-grace). So maybe.
242,1,biden,Murdoch is pissed at Trump because he expects him to start a competitor to Fox News after he stops being president.
243,1,biden,Trump news.....no please gods no
244,1,biden,"maybe it's wishful thinking, but i kinda of think it would be good for the country.  Let the Republicans splinter into two groups, and hopefully the Dems can remain united and actually compromise with the Moderate Conservatives,  while the Radical Conservatives run off on their own yelling at clouds."
245,1,biden,It's not going to happen. The GOP is screwed without Trump's base. They'll drag the whole party in a Trumpian direction instead.
246,1,biden,"Yeah wtf, did the past four years not happen for someone?"
247,1,biden,"They did happen, and he *still* got nearly 70 million people to vote for him.  

Theres no way the GOP doesnt count that as a win.  

So theyll spew the same hate and MAGA vitriol in four years, but just with someone who theyll coach to not insult lovable dead senators in key states on Twitter.

What scares me the most is that Trump probably wins if he tweets only 50% less.  Even worse, Trump wins by a landslide if he just shuts up about COVID and lets the CDC take the blame.  Thats how big theyve grown the single-issue hate base."
248,1,biden,"A lot longer than 4 years. The Tea Party is another example of the same thing. They even called themselves a separate party and the GOP leaders felt their grasp on power slipping, so they started kowtowing to every batshit belief those people had to keep them in the fold."
249,1,biden,"Oh sweet, I wasn't too sure if he'd listen to the democratic process we've been using for centuries but if it's on Fox News we're good."
250,1,biden,"You joke but, it's happened an obscene amount of times where Trump goes off the rails, and Fox talkshow hosts have to give him marching orders like ""the president really has to [X] to make this right"" and very next day camp Trump can be seen making a show of doing [X]"
251,1,biden,Rupert Murdoch is more powerful than the President. Another problem that needs to be fixed.
252,1,biden,There are many people more powerful than the President and they have no desire to run for President and to be thrust into the limelight.
253,1,biden,It's hard to pull the strings of corruption while up front and center stage.
254,1,biden,Yeah but you can't beat that view...
255,1,biden,"Murdoch owns over 70% of australian media. He's a cancer on this planet!

Edit. Word"
256,1,biden,"As usual, he is golfing"
257,1,biden,I absolutely love that he's out golfing when they made the call.  So freaking fitting.  Wonder how many clubs he broke.
258,1,biden,I'm sure anyone with him is scared to tell him.
259,1,biden,I hope there's an intern just SICK of his shit and realizes this is his chance for glory.
260,1,biden,"How do you resist saying ""yuh fired"" though?"
261,1,biden,"This will be some scene in a film, Alec Baldwin as Trump on the golf course being informed he has lost the election and the ensuing meltdown"
262,1,biden,"Trumpty Dumpty promised a wall

Trumpty Dumpty had a great fall

All the golf courses and all the white men

Couldn't Make America Great Again"
263,1,biden,I don't care if you made this up or stole it. It is just so perfect
264,1,biden,he breaks a club over Jared Kushners head and says to himself I won this election
265,1,biden,Lowest score wins there
266,1,biden,"What a perfect summary of Trump.

He golfs as the world he created burns to the ground."
267,1,biden,"""Maybe I was wrong and premature to declare victory on election night, this is clearly the wish of the people and I should ensure this transition is as smooth as possible""- Trump I assume"
268,1,biden,"Ha. Dude youre right. Lets go check his Twitter. Im sure hes being humbled. 

I won this election by a lot! - 1 hour ago 


Oh. Anyways."
269,1,biden,"""Official sources may not have called the race when this was Tweeted"" is the funniest fucking tag right now"
270,1,biden,"Somewhere in Twitter HQ, someone's finger is flexing toward the ""delete account"" button."
271,1,biden,Polishing that ban hammer.
272,1,biden,"Nah, hes still president until January.  So hes got a couple more months to bitch constantly and accomplish absolutely nothing."
273,1,biden,"Rudy's holding some clown show press conference in Philly right now claiming how Democrats had dead people vote including Will Smiths father, but only in areas Trump lost of course."
274,1,biden,Need everyone on the right to not give him a choice on the matter.
275,1,biden,Fox already turning on him. Will take maybe a few days until the rest follows suit after being told what to think.
276,1,biden,I have a bet with my wife that he never gives a concession speech. He will leave the White House claiming the Dems cheated and stole the election. He will never admit defeat publicly.
277,1,biden,congrats to OP for all of the awards they're about to get.
278,1,biden,"[OP: *I'm rich, bitch!*](https://giphy.com/gifs/student-loan-JFtBdzISY7tpS)"

283,1,biden,So how many reddit coins do you have now?
284,1,biden,"Over 38,000, so enjoy the gold on me!

Edit 2: Holy shit 200k upvotes, puts this in the top 10 upvoted post of all time. OMG.

Edit 3: And up to 11.5 years after a third Ternion award, Jesus Christ that thing's $125 please don't give that money to reddit, give it to [a charity that deserves it](https://www.familiesbelongtogether.org/), not a corporation!

If youre excited, please consider giving to a good cause today. Everyone is struggling from COVID and your money is going further than ever at most charities and nonprofits.

Edit 5: Been 24 hours now, looks like this will end up the #3 upvoted Reddit post of all time, thankfully [not beating The Senate or Rick Astley](https://www.reddit.com/top?t=all). Currently at 15 years, six months, and five days of Reddit Premium, with over 80,000 coins gained in total. Hell of a day."
285,1,biden,C....can I... can I have some?
286,1,biden,I don't see why not!
287,1,biden,Tax the rich! ( u/throwawaynumber53 )
288,1,biden,"What do you exactly do with Reddit gold anyway? Does it actually have some sort of value, or is it just like awards on your profile?"
289,1,biden,"You can award stuff to threads and comments to make them more visible and seem more legit. 

Basically, to a degree, you can control the narrative, push it in your favour, if you have enough coins and awards to give out."
290,1,biden,Im walking home from getting coffee in Philly right now and all these people just poured out into the streets screaming and celebrating. Amazing.
291,1,biden,Yeah I work a late shift in d.c. was just woke up to screaming and cheering and knew exactly what happened.
292,1,biden,Friend just sent me a video from NYC everyone honking and banging pans. Unreal
293,1,biden,"Live in NYC here, people are coming out and screaming joy!"
294,1,biden,My husband just busted into the bedroom and woke me up from a deep sleep (9am here in Cali) to share the news... then I loaded up the ole internet machine and the first post on my Instagram feed was of my friend partying in the streets with a crowd singing fuck Donald Trump. I wanna know why youre such a cunt and I just really want that type of wake up call every morning.
295,1,biden,Best way to wake up!
296,1,biden,"The best part of waking up, is by saying ""fuck Donald Trump."""
297,1,biden,Sounds like a great temporary phone ringer or wake up alarm tone!
298,1,biden,"Yeah Im in DC and the second CNN called it people just opened their doors and cheered from their balcony. 

Its been a rough four years, particularly this year, but finally, we have reason to be hopeful."

Edit: Quarantine people, chill. I know its a pandemic, Ive literally been in my apartment since March. Just saying honking horns in celebration, cheery moods, socially distant celebrating"
312,1,biden,"I thought the same.
Then I remembered im in panhandle of Texas."
313,1,biden,Yep. In Plano. I heard one car honk and I whooped in return. I think thats as much as Im gonna get.
314,1,biden,Vid or pics?
315,1,biden,Id love to see a video too.
316,1,biden,But all The Trumpers told me Biden was doomed because of the attendance of his rallies
317,1,biden,Maybe if so many people didn't attend Trump's Corona virus spreading rallies more of them would have been alive to vote for him.
318,1,biden,I had somebody tell me because Trump has 30 milliln facebook likes hell always get re-elected.
319,1,biden,"[This was not a joke. She was dead serious.](https://i.imgur.com/YtjrTyV.jpg) Once people made her realize how stupid she was, she deleted it."
320,1,biden,"Funny, I had a similar interaction. Except she also provided FB likes, Twitter followers and Instagram followers."
321,1,biden,"I had someone share ""how many of your FB friends like Trump v Biden. Trump wins everytime!""

Thank God we don't vote based on who our crazy uncle follows on Facebook."
322,1,biden,Its such a bizarre thing they get stuck on. Even now part of the conspiracy is that Biden got more votes than Obama and thats impossible without rallies. Im not sure a rally has ever affected my views on anything even silly shit like school spirit in high school

329,1,biden," 

Dee wants to vote early and get it over with, but Mac and Dennis keep getting in her way because they think voting is stupid - for different reasons..... Mac thinks voting goes against the will of God, while Dennis is convinced that voting is playing right into the scheme of the big system, and will eventually lead to fascism/theocracy.

Charlie decides that he is sick of the bar and thinks it's the perfect time to pursue his dream and become a mailman. He does so but can't figure the job out, so ends up bringing all the mail home.... which ends up being hundereds of ballots. They don't find the ballots until Dee turns Charlie in because she's been hearing about all the delays. When the cops show up to get the ballots from Charlie, they find him passed out from all the drugs he found in the mail, which he decided to take all at once.

Meanwhile Frank is busy driving around the state in Dee's car, as fast as he can, going to different ""Count the Vote"" and ""Stop the Counting"" rallies. He thinks sowing discord will be good for his business, but he gets in over his head and somehow ends up naked at a vote count complex

In the end, Dee never gets to vote, Charlie goes to jail to sober up, Mac and Dennis end up mad at eachother (again), and Frank gets on national television, naked"
330,1,biden,"Nice. Only thing I would change is Dee actually got her voted mailed in at the beginning, then at the end, we find out the only vote of the gang that actually did get counted was the mail-in one Dee sent in. Would be fitting."

376,1,biden,I read it. Sorry for what happened to your mother. Here is to wishing for the brighter future ahead of us.
377,1,biden,"I read it. Congratulations USA, NZ is so pleased for you."
378,1,biden,Just because the replies are coming in frantically doesn't mean people won't see it. At least I saw it. I share in your joy for the future and am sorry for your loss. I'm proud to be an American again after 4 years of embarrassment.
379,1,biden,[Finally](https://giphy.com/gifs/reactionseditor-3oKIPf3C7HqqYBVcCk)
380,1,biden,Honestly watching the election drag on for 5 days it has felt like the LOTR ending
381,1,biden,"I *hope* it's more like the movie than the book, because otherwise we still have to deal with the Scouring of the Shire."
382,1,biden,Everyone still loves ya
383,1,biden,A lady was blasting We are the Champions. in a Walmart parking lot while wearing her Biden/Harris mask lmao
384,1,biden,"Those giving awards to this post, please please please consider donating those funds to the special election happening in GA with Jon Ossof and Raphael Warnock. If we can get a senate majority and ditch Moscow Mitch, we may actually be able to see real change.

Donate to Ossof here: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/social2_2020_10_05_ro_tjo?refcode=social2

Donate to Warnock here: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/wfg-social?refcode=enight

If unsure who to donate to, I would recommend Stacy Abram's organization as well: https://fairfight.com/

She was responsible for flipping GA blue during the election by registering 800k voters."
385,1,biden,This election may have a subtle lesson of political theory that maybe it isn't a great idea to always be a massive piece of shit all the time about everything.
386,1,biden,It worked the first time
387,1,biden,Damn near worked this time. I can't get my fucking head around it.
388,1,biden,69 million fucking people.
389,1,biden,Not nice
390,1,biden,"And the scary thing is that without covid, then it likely would have worked a second time."
391,1,biden,"Even with COVID if his response was anything close to sensible he would definitely have been elected again. Fortunately for the people alive and unfortunately for all the dead, Trump is incompetent and couldn't rally together a proper fitting response to the pandemic and instead lashed out at the scientists. If his ego hadn't gotten in the way and if he'd just told everyone to wear masks he would have been elected for sure"
392,1,biden,"The reality is that the country is split 50/50. Its the echo chambers we hang in that make it seem like were an overwhelming majority.

:) My first gold. Thanks kind strangers"
393,1,biden,"Dems won the popular vote in the last 7 out of 8 elections. They are the clear majority, they just have to deal with a political system that creates massive potential for minority rule."
394,1,biden,"I live in the south and my family are all conservative. I still don't get it. We used to talk politics but since Trump, I basically ask them why the things he days and does are okay and they just clam up and change the subject. It's baffling that this piece of fucking shit has mobilized so many people."
395,1,biden,"Its crazy.  My parents wi talk about tax evasion with gifts to Hunter Biden with a straight face, and all of a sudden stop wanting to talk when I start talking Trump's kids.

Confront them on the hypocrisy and they just shut down."
396,1,biden,"Shut down and tune out. It never moves the needle for them one inch. Anything Trump does is good and true and anything a liberal does is Satanic. There's apparently 68 million of these people, it's a madhouse."
397,1,biden,"Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me...fool me twice...you can't get fooled again"
398,1,biden,"Even with Trump's shittiness, he still managed to amass 70 million+ votes from the American public, and I think that's something we have to consider going forward."
399,1,biden,"Exactly. Ppl vote with their gut, and their gut obviously told them...idk i got nothing"
400,1,biden,"This exactly. I'm actually shocked at how close this race was. How did 70 million people see these past four years of division and misinformation and failure and think, ""Yes I want more of that""??"
401,1,biden,"Well, now that you say it out loud it seems obvious."
402,1,biden,If it wasn't for covid though that strategy would have worked
403,1,biden,But it does say you can be a piece of shit most of the time.
404,1,biden,"I mean, being a piece of shit still got him to convince 70mil people that he was right. That's the scary part"
405,1,biden,Yup. Next time we might not get so lucky.
406,1,biden,It was an hour ago that he tweeted that but I really enjoy twitters ! Warning under it.
407,1,biden,"is it too early to start chanting ""LOCK HIM UP!"" outside the White House?"
408,1,biden,4 years ago would've been nice
409,1,biden,The best time was 4 years ago. Second best time is today.
410,1,biden,I think im speaking for all of europe...finally its done!
411,1,biden,"Us Canadians no longer have to deal with our ""best ally"" trying to drunkenly punch us in the face every other day anymore.

For the love of God America, never again."
412,1,biden,thank fuck honestly
413,1,biden,As a Brit I'd formally like to congratulate the American people. WELL DONE BROTHERS
414,1,biden,"Proud Canadian citizen here,

For all +72 million of you that voted....I owe each and very one of you a HUGE leg hump!! Im extremely happy for your country. May the next 4 years of your democratic process/leadership, be peaceful and productive. Good luck!!"
415,1,biden,Thank you Canada! Let's be good neighbors again! d
416,1,biden,"I did the math - u/throwawaynumber53 has 6227 days/204 months/17 years of Reddit Premium (Which is worth $849.83 or £605.47)

He has earnt 155,350 coins (Which is worth $395.91 or £282)

11,100 coins have been gifted to the community (Which is worth $33.95 or £24.19)

He has been gifted 11,018 awards (The most in Reddit history)

These awards cost 2,575,070 Reddit Coins, meaning that everyone spent $6393.85, or £4458.85 - with this you could buy 111,471 and 1/4 carrots. (According to Tesco, carrots cost 4 pence each) 

On Average, a tin of Heinz Beans contains 465 beans. A tin is £0.85 or $1.19, meaning one bean costs, on average, 0.18 pence. This means that with £1 you can buy 549.5 Baked Beans. This also means that with the money everyone spent on awards, you could buy a whopping 2,450,138 Baked Beans. 1 Baked Bean is approximately 832mm Cubed / 0.83cm Cubed/0.00000083 Cubic Meters. 0.00000083 x 2,450,138 = 2.036 Cubic Metres.

A Hot-Tub holds 320 Gallons, or 1.45 Cubic Meters. A Microwave holds 40 Litres, or 0.04 Cubic Meters.

2.036 - 1.45 = 0.586 

This means that you can fill 15 Microwaves and one Hot Tub with all of the Beans (If you squished them all together.)

TL;DR .If all the Redditors who spent money on this post spent money on baked beans instead, they would be able to fill a hot tub and 15 microwaves w/ the beans.

Yes I did the math."

438,1,biden,"ITS NOT OVER!  REDDITORS OF GEORGIA. YOU HAVE A MASSIVELY HUGE SENATE RUN OFF ELECTION!

Get all your friends out to vote for the DEM candidates. This could help the Dem presidency massively. If the Republican senators win in Georgia. McConnell having control of the senate means that he will block anything he wants. DONT LET THAT HAPPEN!


Edit: details for the run-off election below:
January 5th, but it seems that their will be vote early mail-in ballot as well.
https://georgia.gov/vote-2020-runoff-elections


This is SO CRUCIAL to our democracy and the success of the Biden administration. Whichever party has control over the Senate puts in place a 'Majority leader' and with Mitch McConnell as the senate majority leader, he has had control over what the Senate chooses to vote on and he has ABUSED that power to no end. He tabled almost every Corona Relief stimulus bill that the House(democrat controlled) passed and refuses to take other very critical bills to vote on in the Senate. This goes back to the Obama administration. McConnell was crucial in rushing the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett through the senate confirmation, while a corona relief bill sat on his desk, which is still sitting there because Trump told him not to vote on it before the election."
439,1,biden,West Texas reporting in. Wishing I could take part in the celebrations but it's both unwise (for myself and family) to do so and not happening here. People are fuming. Y'all celebrate some for us Democratic Texans stuck deep in red territory please!
440,1,biden,Same for us in Arkansas! I love seeing everyones posts and videos from other states and wish I could celebrate with them.
441,1,biden,Republican second. But Patriot first. I am happy and relieved Biden won.
442,1,biden,"So this is what good news feels like ? But it never should have been this close - even in the electoral college.

Close to 70 million Americans saw a president:

\- extort foreign countries to smear his opponent

\-that paid $750 in US taxes, but hundreds in thousands for taxes in foreign countries, and 130k given to strippers

\- that encouraged violence against protesters and regularly defends killer cops

\-that mismanaged an epidemic so badly that 300k excess americans died.

\- that regularly gets laughed at on the world stage

\- that packed the courts with partisan hacks.

\- a president that was ok with bounties placed on US soldiers

\- whose administration had higher turnover than a McDonalds restaurant

**but wait theres more !**

\-that was friends with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and wished Ghislaine Maxwell to do well

\- that played war games with Iran leading to the deaths of dozens of Canadian citizens 

\-that kept untold many children in cages, separating them from their families

\-that broke most of his main promises. No wall that mexico paid for, no resurgence of coal plants, etc

\-that has a history of racism including spreading conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate, calling for the execution of the central park five (black men that were innocent!), 

And said...yup I want four more years of that !"
443,1,biden,"I'll say this though:

I too have given too much money to strippers"
444,1,biden,"-that acted like a man child the first debate

-that told the proud boys ""stand back, stand by""

-that actively tried to kill the USPS 

-that said ""12 more years"" 

-that tried to jail his political opponents

-that failed to get any of his campaign promises done other than a rich tax cut

-that had the longest shutdown in history for nothing in return 

-that has 26 sexual assult claims, one asking for DNA he won't provide

-that says he is godly but tear gassed a pastor and has 3 wives he cheated on 

-that put all of his kids in cushy gov jobs while saying bidan did the same with hunter

-that told them in a rally he didn't want to see them but was forced to

-that demands loyalty tests for gov positions that are supposed to be non partisan

I could be here all day"
445,1,biden,"&gt;that actively tried to kill the USPS 

Let's not forget the postmaster general Dejoy was in Trumps pocket, and actively disregarded ballot sweeps in key swing states and still lost.

I truly hope we throw Dejoy in prison along with Trump. 300k missing ballots is voter suppression and likely would've widened the margins even more in bidens favor"
446,1,biden,I'm French and i'm so glad Trump is finally fired ! Must be such a relief for you American friends !
447,1,biden,I just want to say how refreshing it was to have someone addressing the nation that sounded intelligent and not a man child.
448,1,biden,"Joe Biden ran for President three times, lost a wife and two kids to different tragedies, and is going to work to the age of eighty-two when retirement age is sixty-five. He finally won. That's persistence right there. That's American."
449,1,biden,People working into their 80s is as American as it gets!
450,1,biden,And losing loved ones!
451,1,biden,"He is a definitely a persistent man.  While I agree with all of your comment and the sentiment within, if working until 82 is the new American way we're in trouble.  This is a huge win for the country but I have serious reservations about a man his age in a high stress, high pressure and 24/7/365 position."

They didn't, the voters did.  The AP just told you what the vote counts say."
463,1,biden,"Wait he went through that whole speech without attacking people, spouting conspiracy theories, or ranting about himself and how amazing he is. Is that okay? Is that what presidents sound like? I've forgotten over the past four years."
464,1,biden,"I love the Conservative subs trying to pretend like they don't care. Also saying stupid shit like ""where are our riots""? After Trump mobs tried to storm ballot counting centers and threatened violence against poll workers."
465,1,biden,"Hi, Brazilian here. Is it real? Is it really happening? Do we have a chance now to maybe be rid of all the fascists who rose to power under his influence? Can we... can we dream? Can I dream again of a world without Bolsonaro justifying his every atrocity because of Trump? I never liked Biden, but it just feels so surreal and incredible to think that Trump might be gone now, at least for now. Just... what?"

470,1,biden,I really wanna see Trump crying during his next speech.
471,1,biden,Bruh he might not get a next speech
472,1,biden,He'll make 100 tweets whining each day.
473,1,guilty,"Chauvin had 18 complaints against him. Dude never learned, never changed his ways and now a man is dead and his own life is royally fckd"
474,1,guilty,He shouldve been weeded out of the force years ago.
475,1,guilty,"The problem is that bad officers are rarely weeded out unless their behavior threatens another officer. Like an abusive family, the culture is to cover for eachother first. I've had cops I know through my court assigned cases (I'm a therapist) specifically call me a 'civilian friend' as if they live in another universe all together."
476,1,guilty,"""You call something a war and pretty soon everybody gonna be running around acting like warriors. They gonna be running around on a damn crusade, storming corners, slapping on cuffs, racking up body counts. And when you at war, you need a fucking enemy. And pretty soon, damn near everybody on every corner is your fucking enemy. And soon the neighborhood that you're supposed to be policing, that's just occupied territory."""
477,1,guilty,"I was a troubled kid/teenager/young adult. I had many, many, many run-ins with the law. Not once did I ever deal with a LEO, juvy worker, probation officer, or corrections officer that had an ounce of humanity or human compassion. They're all in cahoots together. It's nothing but ego and narcissism with them. Those types specifically seek out jobs that allow personalities like that to terrorize."
478,1,guilty,"When all you have is a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail"
479,1,guilty,"This is important. Look at depictions of police officers prior to Reagan. I always point out the Andy Griffith show and even Gunsmoke, and compare it to todays shows.

The first shows gaffes and slow towns, where things go bad but majority of the problems are the sheriff helping out residents (gumsmoke is a western so obviously it has more shooting) and compare it to cops, NCIS, Chicago PD. These new shows are like war porn and depicting them doing insane adrenaline pumping cases which clearly show case them as heroes AND having extreme wisdom. Its all propaganda and Chicago PD shows cops breaking protocols to complete cases like torturing suspects during interrogation or stealing police resources to bypass redtape. THAT SHOW LITERALLY ADVOCATES BREAKING THE LAW TO ENFORCE THE LAW."
480,1,guilty,It's sad that the Wire is as relevant today as it was when released...just shy of 20 years ago.  Every time I watch the show it reinforces the little progress that has been made.
481,1,guilty,"The book is even older....scary shit.

Homicide a life on the streets was another TV that was based on the book and that came out in 1993.."

484,1,guilty,Are they soldiers or something? Apparently they dont consider themselves civilians which is really concerning.
485,1,guilty,"Google ""killology""

Tl;dr yes, they think they are soldiers"
486,1,guilty,"I think it mainly stems from how police organizations are structured. Which is militaristic. The problem is cops aren't the military and the public aren't enemies. 

I got into a argument with a colleague about this and I was pointing out how cops don't have consequences as drastic as a military personnel for when they mess up. He stated they do but enforcement is up to superiors and it just showed that the current system is wrong. There needs to be a outside jurisdiction that oversees punishment and reviews not a inhouse chief."
487,1,guilty,"They'd be *bad* soldiers if they thought that's who they were. 

No soldier would be so undisciplined."
488,1,guilty,The only people they weed out are people like [Adrian Schoolcraft](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Schoolcraft)
489,1,guilty,"Let us not forget, either, that isn't even the first time he's done exactly this (sans the killing bit but still, I can count the number of times I've done this personally on one hand that's had my fingers amputated):

&gt; The investigation included the killing of Floyd on May 25, 2020, and other incidents involving Chauvin, such as a September 2017 case where Chauvin pinned a 14-year old boy for several minutes with his knee while ignoring the boy's pleas that he could not breathe; the boy briefly lost consciousness.

Edit to add: link for the above 2017 situation. Shits fucked yo. Hit the kid in the back of the head with his flashlight, threw him to the ground and put his knee on the kids neck for 17 minutes, after which he started bleeding from the ear. 

&gt; [When he refused, Chauvin grabbed him and, without saying anything, struck the teen in the head with his flashlight and then grabbed him by the throat, before hitting him again with the flashlight  all of which occurred less than a minute after the officers first encountered the boy, prosecutors said.](https://www.startribune.com/chauvin-prosecutors-cite-incident-with-14-year-old-boy-who-couldn-t-breathe/573105501/)"

491,1,guilty,"Right? Take a trip on down to Wikipedia lane and check out his history...

Not related to this case, but to Chauvin as a character, he also has [several tax evasion felonies](https://apnews.com/article/56bea6e3d1ea1aaeba129522df43294f) under his belt.  And by ""several"" I mean 9."

Note, the state fucking ***certified*** these pieces of shit, and the article is talking about what they're now doing to prevent it from happening again.  In 2019.  Nothing has happened since."
503,1,guilty,"For clarity's sake, 9 felony charges, not convictions.  


It'll be nice to read another headline in a year or two about the convictions, though!"
504,1,guilty,"I didn't file my taxes for ten years (and am currently working out a payment plan with the IRS, so I'm comfortable admitting this), and you know how many tax evasion charges I have against me? Zero. You really have to be going out of your way and just blatantly steal money from the government to even get the one..."
505,1,guilty,"I'm laughing so hard at how stupid this guy is. Like you know, not filing isn't an automatic felony. You have to actively try and hide income from the IRS.

Dude didn't file for years...got hit with a murder investigation that would rip into every detail of his life...and then when forced to back-file **still** lied about close to $500k in income over 6ish years."
506,1,guilty,"The guy thinks violence is the remedy for non violent money related crimes while he had 9 under his belt. That's  not to detract from the entirety of the rest of his miserable existence, but it puts yet another spin on just how terrible this piece of shit is."
507,1,guilty,Also voting fraud.
508,1,guilty,"Came here to say the same thing! Ive heard tons about George Floyds drug use and his criminal record, but no one was talking about Chauvins? What a narrative the media can fucking weave."
509,1,guilty,Yeah Mr. Floyd forgot his hall pass in fifth grade but Chauvin is a literal scum of the earth person that Fox News paints as a patriot or some shit.
510,1,guilty,Wow.  Dude was an absolute prick.
511,1,guilty,"More importantly, his supervisors should be punished for over looking his behaviour"
512,1,guilty,Huge point here. Chauvin did the deed but there are many to blame for George Floyds death.
513,1,guilty,"It's like charging a firearms owner if they left a loaded gun lying around and something bad happened as a result. Or maybe it's more like charging a dog owner if their dogs maul someone.

They kept putting him out on the streets, armed and badged. Something like this is the direct result of those decisions. They need to be charged with some form of negligence."
514,1,guilty,"Hence why his bosses all testified that his actions against Floyd werent sanctioned by the department, even though as OP has demonstrated they clearly were (otherwise hed have been removed from duty earlier). They were so clearly covering their own asses by making him a scapegoat."
515,1,guilty,"&gt; They kept putting him out on the streets, armed and badged. 

Here is my biggest beef with the current state of law enforcement.  Even if Chauvin had been fired for some previous incident, he would have been hired somewhere else.  It happens every time."
516,1,guilty,"Chauvin bent the knee, but his boss oversaw the deed"
517,1,guilty,"Thats a great point.  The bosses looking the other way only enables the behaviour and builds the culture that anything can justify their actions.  The tone of a workplace, regardless of where you work, is trickled down from the top."
518,1,guilty,Now hes a cop in jail which is lower than a pedo
519,1,guilty,Lol like hell ever see general population.
520,1,guilty,IS an absolute prick. I hope he rots in prison.
521,1,guilty,"If all of his sentences are consecutive (one can only hope), he won't be getting out until he's in his fucking **90s**.  If they're concurrent, he's still going to be roughly 60-70 before being eligible for parole.  Basically, his useable life is over now and I bet he knows that."
522,1,guilty,If he gets more than 15 years Ill be surprised. I hope youre right.
523,1,guilty,"&gt; Hit the kid in the back of the head with his flashlight

Keep in mind that police use a heavy duty maglite that a lot of departments lovingly refer to as ""Killsticks."" An aluminum shell loaded with 4 d-cell batteries, the things pack a punch"
524,1,guilty,"I keep one in my car for that exact reason, and it's not for providing light; I have a headlamp for that. The Maglite is ~20"" long, weighs ~1.32 lbs, has _6_ D cells, and is absolutely a weapon. Far more deadly than the legally questionable kubotan that I also have."
525,1,guilty,"A retired police officer commented that after watching the video and seeing chauvins expression (or lack thereof), the first thing that came to his mind was this guys done this before."
526,1,guilty,"Yeah, this was a favourite dominance move of his"
527,1,guilty,"I firmly believe that one of the main reasons he would not get off Floyd even when it was obvious he was out and probably dead was because he did not want the crowd to ""win.""  He would rather someone die than feel like he was wrong and they were right."
528,1,guilty,"The public definitely needs to be protected from a guy like this who managed to work himself into a position of power.  

I'm not big into crime&amp;punishment thinking, but some people are so dangerous that the public needs to be protected from them -- and Chauvin should be in prison on that basis.

Next, we need to find and remove the other people like him on the police force, BEFORE they fuck up and kill someone.

Hopefully the federal review of the Minneapolis will serve as a model for how to do this.  But I'll believe it when I see it."
529,1,guilty,Fourteen! Jesus.
530,1,guilty,I had not heard that.  It was only a matter of time before he killed someone.
531,1,guilty,"Seems like Chauvin learned that move and just kept using it longer and longer, in sort of a sick way of testing it. 17 mins on someones neck is a long damn time! I thought the point of holding someone down is to cuff them as quickly as possible, not to torture. Dude was a psycho on a power trip."
532,1,guilty,"Local man at McDonalds has 18 complaints of shitting in the shake machine, still works for McDonalds - If cops had normal jobs and got away with everything."

534,1,guilty,"The people who say ""Well George Floyd had a criminal record"" are the same that say Chauvin's previous complaints shouldn't count against him.

And I'll say it, these are probably the people that, with no matter how much evidence presented to them, would still think he's not guilty."
535,1,guilty,My family (I dont associate with anymore because of how fucking toxic they are) last year swore up &amp; down that Chauvin did nothing wrong &amp; was within his rights as an officer. You can spit out trash all day but it doesnt make it a daisy. Period.
536,1,guilty,"Yep I had a friend do that as well.  She said Floyd should have never broken the law in the first place.  I asked her, What If that was your son getting kneeled on calling out for you? She didnt have an answer.  And her son HAS been arrested in the past. I just dont understand some people...."
537,1,guilty,"&gt;The people who say ""Well George Floyd had a criminal record"" are the same that say Chauvin's previous complaints shouldn't count against him.

Lol no they won't even acknowledge it. Every time I engage an idiot defending Chauvin on here they just stops responding."
538,1,guilty,"Well, on the off chance now that Chauvin somehow ends up mingling with the general population and takes a fatal shiv, we can just point to his criminal record now and say he deserved it.  That's how sticking to talking points works right?  You stick to them because it would be hypocritical to say otherwise at this point."
539,1,guilty,Thats a sharp point you made there.
540,1,guilty,"Right. People want to say ""Floyd had a record"" but they don't want to talk about chauvin's."
541,1,guilty,"He was bigger piece of shit than you know. Also evading taxes. Typical cop who didn't care about abusing the system, because he always got away with it before.

542,1,guilty,"Alongside that, he registered his primary vehicle (a BMW suv) in FL because its less expensive to do but drove it year-round in MN. Also tried to claim FL residency to try and skirt MN state income taxes if Im not mistaken. Just a piece of work all around."
543,1,guilty,"Don't think of it that way, putting all the accountability on him. There were eighteen complaints about him and he wasn't being required to address his behavior and professionalism. Police departments need to be keeping their officers accountable through monitoring, statistical analysis, and persistent best practices retraining. Derek Chauvin should never have been allowed to get to this point."
544,1,guilty,Bail revoked too. He'll be in jail until his sentencing trial.
545,1,guilty,"Is someone EVER convicted of murder and let out on bail? That would seem, odd.

I'd have thought bail was only an option when:

1 you aren't yet guilty, and are low risk

1b you are on appeal

2  you aren't going to prison for long anyway (or at all), and the sentencing may take longer than the likely sentence"
546,1,guilty,I was watching an episode of Real Detective (which are real stories) yesterday where a guy committed suicide in his backyard between his conviction and sentencing (on a murder charge) so it must happen.
547,1,guilty,"They don't typically give people convicted of murder bail. They know they're going away forever. There is no amount of money that can force them to come back.

edit: Yes he doesn't have a life sentence coming but he's 45, the max is 40 years, and he's a well known killer cop. There's a large chance he never gets back out."
548,1,guilty,"Yup. Youd at least try and skip town if not off yourself. Death is better than life in prison, especially for a killer cop."
549,1,guilty,*any cop. They generally aint liked much in prison regardless of their crimes.
550,1,guilty,Only way to be lower on the food chain is to be a pedo cop.

552,1,guilty,"I think we can take solace in the fact that jail is jail, he's rotting in there regardless of the extra ramen a sympathetic CO might let him sneak now and again."
553,1,guilty,"All this guy had to do, was let him up after he was in handcuffs. One would still be alive, and one wouldn't be going to jail..."
554,1,guilty,He was already in handcuffs when Chauvin arrived on the scene. Floyd was never not in handcuffs when Chauvin was there.
555,1,guilty,Important fact.
556,1,guilty,Yeah not stressed enough.
557,1,guilty,Ohh man I didn't even know that and I still thought he was guilty. Fuck there is no argument against this verdict.
558,1,guilty,"The only reason why there was even arguments was if the drugs factored more in the death. Yes Floyd was high, but, no, that was not the end for him.


Happy 4/20 everyone."
559,1,guilty,"My argument when people say the drugs caused the asphyxiation is always ""when someone can't breathe, do you call for an ambulance, or keep your knee on his neck?"""
560,1,guilty,Better yet... when you known someone has no pulse... do you take necessary action to start CPR? Or keep your knee on his neck?
561,1,guilty,"What about when a paramedic tells you to remove your knee and you dont.

I'm suprised they didn't go for first degree murder."
562,1,guilty,"Better yet... when the person whose neck you have your knee on stops moving, do you take your knee off and check his vitals, or keep your knee on his neck for several more minutes, you know, just for good measure."
563,1,guilty,"My argument is ""then why was force needed?"". Like if someone is so high on a downer that it is stopping their breathing and they are in handcuffs, why would any level of force be necessary?"
564,1,guilty,"The health arguments were pro forma defense bullshit. There are millions of people walking around with hypertension, heart disease, and even taking fetanyl who will live long and happy lives if no one kneels on their neck for 9 minutes."
565,1,guilty,Happy 420 ..I also love the defense argument ..that his health issues and addiction issues were more of a factor than a knee on your neck for almost 10 minutes ..:ridiculous
566,1,guilty,"Literally the best argument is that Floyd coincidentally dropped dead from a heart defect/drugs while Chauvin was kneeling on him, but that kneeling on him had zero effect whatsoever.  To not think Chauvin was guilty, you have to believe Floyd would've dropped dead at exactly that moment regardless.

What you'll see most often, though, is garbage humans arguing that it's ok because George Floyd was a bad human and therefore doesn't have a right to not be murdered."
567,1,guilty,This guy is an utter piece of shit.  He kept pressure on Floyds throat several minutes AFTER he was dead.  To me that was intentional to make sure he wasnt merely passed out and knowing that long would kill or cause permanent brain damage.
568,1,guilty,And people were literally begging him to stop.
569,1,guilty,"Yeah.. from one of the videos there was a bystander filming. He said to Chauvin, Youre going to regret this day.. or something.  Not menacingly, just matter-of-fact.. 

..I bet he does now."
570,1,guilty,"The defense insisted that those statements were so ""menacing"" that he just had to keep kneeling on Floyd's neck.  Really, he felt so threatened that he had to keep doing the thing the crowd was disturbed by instead of getting off Floyd and doing the arrest normally as the crowd wanted."
571,1,guilty,Pride. He had to show the crowd HE was in charge. Its amazing the amount of damage a narcissist in power can inflict.
572,1,guilty,"Sad thing is I can believe this. I've seen that ""double down"" mentality a lot with petty authority figures, to whom when questioned the most important thing is maintaining their sense of being in charge"
573,1,guilty,Small people with small amounts of power are the worst.
574,1,guilty,"Cops are trained that they have to be in control of the situation. I'd like the training methodology to be revamped otherwise we'll continue to see this behavior from officers who, as individuals, will believe they are justified in their actions because of the training they received."
575,1,guilty,"I bet he still doesn't think he did anything wrong, either. He probably thinks the media has crucified him for some drug addict's OD."
576,1,guilty,It sounded like those bystanders were struggling to stop themselves from jumping in themselves to try and stop it too. They probably knew that it would end poorly for them as the cops would defend each other instead of doing the right thing.
577,1,guilty,"Sadly, this likely had the inverse effect when that fake alpha energy of they cant tell me what to do kicked in."
578,1,guilty,This. Just had to act like he was dealing with another human being.
579,1,guilty,"&gt; Just had to act like he was dealing with another human being.

Even to just ***act*** like it, he could think differently but still behave humanely and we would not be here. He'd still be an asshole but not a murderer. 

(goddamn this case makes my heart hurt so much. Like the world should not have just gone on after this happened but stopped everywhere for collective grief and reflection)."
580,1,guilty,"Man lost his wife, his kids, his job, his freedom, his whole life and became a convicted murderer in only 8 minutes because he just HAD to show that he was in control. What a dumb bitch."
581,1,guilty,Wonder if hell bother having a jury trial on the tax evasion charges now - I bet that involves a hell of a lot more fraud than $20.
582,1,guilty,"If an alleged fake $20 deserves a knee on your neck for 9 minutes, defrauding the state of Minnesota $38,000~ deserves a knee on your neck for at least 11 days"
583,1,guilty,"Thanks for doing the math, thats a whole Scaramucci!"
584,1,guilty,Genuinely surprised he was found guilty on all three counts.
585,1,guilty,As a non-American can someone explain how you can be charged with murder as well as manslaughter?
586,1,guilty,"I'm an American lawyer who hasn't practiced criminal law for about 4 years so I'm a little rusty.  Basically, as long as each crime has an additional element that the other does not, you can be convicted of both.  

So if Crime A consists of elements 1, 2, 3, and 4 and Crime B consists of elements 2, 3, 4, and 5, you can be convicted of both.

However, if Crime A is 1, 2, 3, and 4, and Crime B is 1, 2, and 3, you can only be convicted of one (it's called a lesser included offense)."
587,1,guilty,"So a good example of this is actually in this case, right? That example being:

Chauvins excessive use of force could be thought of as an assault, but he could never be convicted of assault *and* second degree murder, because the charge of second degree murder (ie felony murder in this case), includes all the elements of the felony being commissioned during said murder. That is, murder 2 includes all the elements of the assault, so the state didnt even bother charging him with it.

If thats right, the question remains: what elements of manslaughter are not included in murder 2?"
588,1,guilty,"One act doesn't mean one law was broken. You can mug some one and be charged with assault and with robbery. (And probably several other things.)

Specifically in this case manslaughter means the officer acted negligently and the result was a death. Second degree murder means that the officer intended to cause harm and it resulted in death.

The judge, however, in sentencing can stack the prison time so it is served concurrently. It doesn't mean (though it can) that the sentences are served consecutively.

EDIT: INAL but to give example on how this isn't a single act I'll add the following.

 I don't know the prosecutor's argument nor the jury's reasoning, but it could be something like this.

Chauvin  assaulted Floyd by intentionally using a painful and violent method of  restraint. This act was intentional and could meet the qualifications  for assault and for second-degree murder.

As  Floyd was continuing to be restrained and displaying signs of distress,  Chauvin should have known to release Floyd or change his restraint  technique. This later act (failure to act) is negligence but not  intended to cause any harm.

It looks like one act but in reality it is a series of on going decisions."
589,1,guilty,"It also means that if the appeals process overturns the 2nd degree murder, the manslaughter will still be there, so he will still be guilty. They would need to successfully appeal all 3 charges to get him out free."
590,1,guilty,Good point.
591,1,guilty,Well an appeal in my country could result in manslaughter in this example
592,1,guilty,"Actually in Minnesota the 2nd degree murder charge isn't only ""with intent"".  In this case it was because it was manslaughter charge in tandem with a felony charge (in this case felony assault), with both together it meets the state's criteria for murder 2."
593,1,guilty,"According to Minnesota's Statute on second degree murder you don't even need to have a second felony charge, you just need to be attempting to commit one.


&gt; 609.19 MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE.
&gt; Subdivision 1.Intentional murder; drive-by shootings. Whoever does either of the following is guilty of murder in the second degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 40 years:
&gt; (1) causes the death of a human being with intent to effect the death of that person or another, but without premeditation; or
&gt; 
&gt; (2) causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting to commit a drive-by shooting in violation of section 609.66, subdivision 1e, under circumstances other than those described in section 609.185, paragraph (a), clause (3).

594,1,guilty,"There are typically conditions that need to be met for charges to be stacked consecutively. Usually, those conditions are reliant on whether someone has criminal history and if the PSI returns a risk to reoffend or is considered a danger to society."

613,1,guilty,"I was very optimistic when they announced they had a verdict because that meant little disagreement, and there's no way 12 people would agree to acquit, especially that quick."
614,1,guilty,"I breathed a small sigh of relief when they said a verdict was reached because I was personally most concerned about this being a hung jury. I didnt think they would all find him not guilty.

Very relieved that justice happened in this case, and it wont heal the pain but I hope it brings some small comfort to the family of George Floyd."
615,1,guilty,"When it was quick, it was obvious it was guilty. Just not on what. No way that prosecution results in a quick acquittal, it would take some time for any holdout to shift to an acquittal. I had zero doubt it was guilty. 

Im legitimately shocked it was for the full plate though."
616,1,guilty,"As the trial progressed, the witnesses brought forth were pretty damning. People who in any other trial would have defended a cop totally slammed him without reservation. The Defense had nothing of substance to work with."
617,1,guilty,"Yep. A long stream of people that wear a badge, wore a badge, or who had been paid to work with those with badges in the past lined up to declare Chauvins guilt. Looking over the case as a whole, its pretty clear, but I was apprehensive until the moment the verdict was read"
618,1,guilty,"I hadn't seen any of the trial but I saw some of the defence summing up, and the videos they showed, and I thought ""Holy fuck! You're the guy *defending* him!"". Even the defence's evidence was damning."

623,1,guilty,I'm boggled that part of the Defense's argument is that carbon monoxide fumes he breathed in from the cop car's exhaust might have contributed to the death...as if the reason he breathed in those fumes wasn't directly related to the accused's actions.
624,1,guilty,Defenses job is to create doubt. I agree it's mind boggling (and also the verdict) but they arent doing their job if they aren't doing everything they can to create doubt.

626,1,guilty,"Full disclosure. At one point in my life, I decided to end it. I started my race truck in my garage, had a good drink, and listened to good music. My good friends figured out my goodbye text, and found me in time. I spent the next month in treatment. The first day. My therapist told me you do know trying to commit suicide with modern cars is ridiculous.  She was being fucking condescending. Looking back on it, I shouldnt have felt as proud as I did explaining to her that not all cars have catalytic converters, and one of the first things you learn as a young tech is what gases cars produce, and how they affect you. Im not sharing this to shame anyone. Im sharing this to inform. If George Floyd had an airtight seal with the tailpipe, he would be breathing less CO than the rest of us."
627,1,guilty,"Yeah, 15 years ago this probably wouldn't have even gone to trial. And if it did, it would not have made the news, the blue line would have held their tongue, and the jury would have instantly sided with the cops and nothing would change. 

Hell, even a few years ago this wouldn't have happened. Not sure if it was the numerous videos, brave witnesses coming forward, pubic opinion souring on the ""Cops are Beyond Reproach"" narratives, or actual change in society that made the difference. Hopefully this will make other cops think twice about excessive force."

I get that they have room to create a defensive argument, but Nelson repeating that to convict, the jury must find that Chauvins actions were the SOLE reason for Floyds death was just a blatant misrepresentation of the jury instructions. It wasnt a one time slip up either. He repeated this over and over. 

Thats not a defensive argument. Thats Nelson trying to confuse the jury on what their job is, and it looks like they didnt appreciate that tactic based on the speed of their decision. 

Cahill reiterated to the jury that they only need to pay attention to the instructions and disregard anything that refutes them. And Blackwell called out Nelson for his straight up lies.

656,1,guilty,It should be noted this verdict only took 10 hours. That's crazy fast.
657,1,guilty,"It was expected to be days.

I was not ready for them to reach that verdict so quickly."
658,1,guilty,"As soon as it came back so quickly, I knew it had to be guilty. It meant no one was a hold out trying to defend him."
659,1,guilty,"I didn't watch all the trial, but the evidence seemed to be pretty overwhelming, from all kinds of witnesses - even including the chief of police. Its important that no one feels they have impunity to needlessly take the life of an innocent person, that everyone is subject to the rule of law. This verdict reinforces that."
660,1,guilty,NPR said this is the first time in history a police chief testified against his own (former) Officer.
661,1,guilty,That's quite something.
662,1,guilty,That was probably due to all the protest and publicity surrounding this.  I feel like they had to pull everything out to throw him under the bus.  What gets me are the countless that haven't been filmed and haven't been publicized where cops get away.
663,1,guilty,"To be fair, the Chief fired Chauvin the next day, stating publicly that he thought DC was responsible for this death and that charges should be filed. His testimony during trial was consistent with his statements during the events of last year. 

It is just historical to see any Chief testify against one of his former officers. But Arradondos position on this has been consistent and clear since the beginning. I think its a huge reason we saw a conviction so fast."
664,1,guilty,He was legit full of sorrow on CNN right after it happened. Took a phone call live from I think Floyds brother. Genuinely good guy.
665,1,guilty,"That chief fired him before this blew up, if I remember right. Credit where it's due."
666,1,guilty,"Fired him the day after, wasn't it? Chief knew it was wrong from the start and hasn't backed off that viewpoint which is shocking to see from that level of command."
667,1,guilty,Agreed. Although bad shoots happen in seconds. He had minutes where he suffocated a person to death and he could have eased up and floyd could have survived.
668,1,guilty,Even a minuscule amount of compassion from the officer would have made a world of difference.
669,1,guilty,"Not exactly true. This same Chief testified in the trial of Minneapolis Officer Mohammad Noor who shot and killed that Australian woman.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Justine_Damond"
670,1,guilty,"And by this time tomorrow we'll see how the chief has received dozens of death threats, and multiple assh0le politicians talking shit about him."
671,1,guilty,"Itll be interesting to see how the rank and file, and the Union, treat him or speak about him."
672,1,guilty,He testified like 2 weeks ago
673,1,guilty,I watched almost all of it and it was not looking good for Chauvin from the very beginning. I'm not surprised they came back this quickly. Hard to hem and haw over what you saw with your own eyes for 9 minutes.
674,1,guilty,"The defense has a fine theory, which was that Chauvin didn't kill Floyd but that instead Floyd died of an OD consuming drugs that he quickly swallowed right before the cops came to hide the evidence. As such, I was concerned after the opening statement. After all, each count required Chauvin *directly* causing the death of Floyd.

But then the defense had absolutely no evidence to support that claim. Their medical expert was worse than the prosecution's expert, and the prosecution did a good job pointing out that the small amount of drugs Floyd consumed did not cause the death. 

The longer it went the more confident I was."
675,1,guilty,What really destroyed the defense too was that the police chief and the officer that trains the other officers in restraint techniques both testified that chauvins use of force was unauthorized and that is not how they train their officers. The police chief also said that chauvin had lied at first about his use of force.
676,1,guilty,Yeah his discussion with his supervisor after the murder was pretty suspect. Didnt mention the use of force at all or what he did reeked of guilt
677,1,guilty,Props to the chief though for turning the investigation over to the right people as soon as he found out what really happened.
678,1,guilty,Generally speaking fast verdict = quick agreement. Slow verdicts tend to be unfavorable for the prosecution
679,1,guilty,"usually they become drawn out affairs due to holdouts needing to be convinced.

nobody needed to be convinced this time"
680,1,guilty,"My understanding is that the quicker the verdict, the worse it is for the defense."
681,1,guilty,"Zimmerman was acquitted after 16 hours of deliberation. OJ was acquitted after just 4 hours. Short deliberations can be a good sign for the prosecution, but not always."
682,1,guilty,Zimmerman basically had one juror holding out for guilty and took a long time to get them to give in. OJ was an 11 month trial and they made up their mind long before deliberation
683,1,guilty,11 months of sequestering is quite a lot of time to run out of fucks to give.
684,1,guilty,"Jury sequestration is crazy in my opinion.

""Oh you'd like to participate in the justice system? Just quit your job, never see your family, and be locked away unable to have outside contact like a prisoner for weeks or months.""

The jurors Chauvin's trial were only ""partially sequestered"" and allowed to go home at night."
685,1,guilty,"You're also forgetting the pay rate...$20 per day and 54 cents per mile for their driving distance.

That's far below poverty level, so if you're the main income source for your family, they're screwed if the trial takes too long."
686,1,guilty,I just googled this and you can file for a financial exemption for jury duty in the US.
687,1,guilty,"&gt; Jury sequestration is crazy in my opinion.

It makes sense for short trials. You don't want people in this trial, for example, basing their decision on what they see on reddit versus what they see in the courtroom.

For longer trials it's crazy"
688,1,guilty,It has to be unanimous. So the longer it takes the more likely there is faction arguing or a lone dissenter.
689,1,guilty,"Pretty ~~damming~~ *damning* evidence though, to be honest.

Edit: We building dams of justice out here"
690,1,guilty,Imagine if there wasn't a video. That's why you should film.
691,1,guilty,"The police would have investigated the police, and found that they did nothing wrong."
692,1,guilty,"Oh come on now, that's not true!

There would be paid administrative leave and then they would simply relocate them to another district!"
693,1,guilty,The cop would require therapy due to the ptsd of having his knee get bruised while he was slowly killing the victim.
694,1,guilty,"don't remind me of daniel shaver

his murderer was rewarded and it makes me sick"
695,1,guilty,Man you just took me to 1000 real quick. That shit still gets my blood boiling. Cold blooded murder while a man was crawling and begging for his life. And then they got the fact he has you're fucked etched on the inside of his dist cover thrown out... I have never been so pissed off by a video in my life.
696,1,guilty,"Kelly Thomas is also really fucking bad

A guy choking to death on his own blood from a police beating who jokingly tell each other ""well, we can't bring him in like that"". They knew how horrifically they just beat someone and laughed it off.

No repercussions."
697,1,guilty,"God that video still haunts me. I regret watching it every day of my life. The complete hellish terror and confusion he was put through before being executed. 

Makes me sick to think about."
698,1,guilty,Kelly calling for his father is still an intrusive thought that goes through my head now and then.
699,1,guilty,you mean this pos [https://www.reddit.com/r/2020PoliceBrutality/comments/msy2u1/philip\_brailsford\_got\_his\_job\_back\_ptsd\_therapy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2020PoliceBrutality/comments/msy2u1/philip_brailsford_got_his_job_back_ptsd_therapy/) that might get his rifle back?
700,1,guilty,"This is exactly why I haven't watched it. I'm afraid of the impact it will have on me. I know that there need to be witnesses to evil in order to stamp it out, but I'm glad that I didn't need to be one of them in this case. 

Throughout the reporting of the trial, I was so moved, and so horrified, by the testimony of the bystanders who witnessed his death. Their guilt and trauma at not being able to help him, and the understanding that he was about to die, have marked them all for life. We should honour them and their strength in testifying."
701,1,guilty,"Ugh this one always sickens me. Watching the video you can tell the cop wants the guy to get shot. The victim could sense it too, which is why he breaks down and begs  for his life. Both cops in that video belong in jail. The one that didn't shoot somehow seems even guiltier to me, but it doesn't matter since nobody was punished for that murder."
702,1,guilty,"Cops: 
*Well, we looked into it and decided we did nothing wrong. Case closed boys*"
703,1,guilty,"See Walter Scott's murder in Charleston, SC. The police were all in on covering up for the cop until the video came out and blew their whole story apart."
704,1,guilty,"The worst part about stuff like that. Even if the officer is convicted. Nothing happens to the officers who lied and covered it up. They dont get charged with obstruction of justice or even false statements, its sickening."
705,1,guilty,"FBI wasn't involved, investigating the cover up?  Seems they should be"
706,1,guilty,"Whenever there is a police involved death, it should be investigated by someone who is not part of the local jurisdiction. There are way too many conflicts of interest."
707,1,guilty,Its a gang well-equipped to protect its own.
708,1,guilty,"Or Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, where the cops were pretty willing to do the white thing until the video the killers made of themselves committing murder got out."
709,1,guilty,"We all carry cameras in our pockets, let's fucking use them. For our neighbors. All of them."
710,1,guilty,States are currently trying pass bills to make it illegal to film police officers. Please be aware.
711,1,guilty,"The police film was enough too in this case.  When one of your colleagues tells you ""No pulse"" and you don't move (he only said huh and tried to get no clarification), it's very clear of your intention.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd party video is definitely a must as the police can't tamper with it then."
712,1,guilty,Police video would have not been sufficient. There never would have been a trial without public outrage.
713,1,guilty,This leads to another question: how many times has there been a George Floyd when no one was watching? Sickening to think about honestly. I hope somewhere they feel vindicated.
714,1,guilty,"Seriously. The whole reason this trial is so important is because it's *that incredibly rare*. Like, cops on trial for causing death should be normal. It shouldn't be this nationwide event, it should just be expected.

One actual trial is infinitely better than the zero we've got before, and better than the just for show trials that absolve all responsibility we've had. But the implications that it takes over a year of nonstop protests for one actual trial is just depressing. Here's to hoping this can be looked back on as the start of change."
715,1,guilty,"My parents were always judgmental of the Black Lives Matter movement. But this case really made my parents realize just how differently black people are being treated and have been treated for so long now. We watched the verdict together and I brought this up to them that this type of activity has been going on for so long but it only got more and  more attention due to the protests that have happened and because we have more video evidence. 

I hope this case marks a change and we start seeing more repercussions for police but it still feels like we have so far to go."
716,1,guilty,What was amazing to me was seeing so many police officers across the nation react to protests with violence and intimidation. They showed how many more bad apples there are still out there.
717,1,guilty,Anyone remember the twisted game of Simon Says that led to an innocent man being shot with an AR-15 at close range in a hotel hallway a few years ago? That cop got less than 8 years.
718,1,guilty,"Just read the press release the police department put out the same day, it describes a totally different event than what took place."
719,1,guilty,"they didn't LIE per se, they just left out the part where the cop murdered somebody by kneeling on his kneck for 8 minutes."
720,1,guilty,"Do you happen to have a link to that? Morbidly curious to see how they tried to twist this, though I can fathom a guess."
721,1,guilty,"Tapper just tweeted it, here ya go:

https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1384622849562873856?s=21"
722,1,guilty,"I LOLd when the defendant closed with ""yes there's a video of 8m and x seconds but what I want you to do is look past BEYOND THAT lmfaaaao"""
723,1,guilty,"I understand a defense lawyer's job is to ensure that the defendent is treated fairly and that all protocols are followed, so ideally the innocent go free and the guilty are proven so irrefutably. In an ideal state, a defense lawyer ensures that everything is performed equitably.

But man, I can't imagine taking a case for this kind of thing and thinking, ""Okay, well now I need to convince people this murderer didn't do a murder."""
724,1,guilty,Totally. I spent days looking at him calmly dissecting every shred of evidence and wonder how someone could repackage a murder as something else. Its unnerving.
725,1,guilty,"Thats the whole point, arguments in the defendants favor deserve to be heard and they deserve to be made on their behalf by someone practiced in law. Doing so ensures justice is performed. Its the prosecutors job to convince people that the defense isnt valid and vice versa. Even when theres video context matters and that context is what the defense and prosecution will debate in front of the jury. Defending someone isnt morally questionable and shouldnt make you feel unnerved. Chauvins lawyer probably knew he was going to be convicted, but he made arguments that he felt deserved to be heard, even if he personally doesnt agree with them."
726,1,guilty,"My dad was on a jury for a murder trial, and the defense attorney managed to concede that multiple witnesses all saw the defendant point a gun at the deceased, shout 'I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker', and pull the trigger, and he still got a hung jury out of it, with several jurors believing that we just couldn't know if he intended to *shoot* the victim, or kill him some other way and the fatal gunshot was an accident."
727,1,guilty,There was a video of Rodney King too.
728,1,guilty,I think having his peers on the stand helped helped the jury decide so quickly
729,1,guilty,"When your murdering is so egregious and blatant that even other cops and the union agree you did the wrong thing, you done fucked up. 

It takes a lot for a cop to fuck up so bad that the rest don't cover for him."
730,1,guilty,"It took an 8 minute video.  Without this evidence, there never would have even been an investigation.  3 cops stood there and let Floyd be murdered in real time."
731,1,guilty,Reminder that this likely doesn't happen without the bystander video.
732,1,guilty,This 100% doesnt happen without bystander video
733,1,guilty,"Says a lot when the same people who cry just a few bad apples do everything they can to protect and retain those apples. 

Its almost like they dont know what youre supposed to do with rotten apples.

Or what happens if you dont."
734,1,guilty,"If only people will stop leaving out the other half of the ""few bad apples"" saying. It's so orwellian how the people supporting the police censor it out. The full saying is ""a few bad apples spoils the bunch"". The same thing happened with the ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" the saying is critical of social darwinism because it's literally impossible, but some how its meaning got appropriated by social darwinists in support of them."
735,1,guilty,"tbh, i'm from the rodney king generation, so i'm surprised it happened even with the video."
736,1,guilty,Shout out to Darnella Frazier for recording the whole 9 minutes for the entire world to see.
737,1,guilty,"Thank you, I hadnt heard her name mentioned yet

Edit: unfortunately people who get involved tend to be targeted, so while its nice to know who made sure justice was served, it would probably be a good idea to not mention her specifically too much to avoid her being doxxed more than she already has, especially with her being so young"
738,1,guilty,I'd really rather people not know her name because witnesses against police violence have a big target on their backs.
739,1,guilty,You mean like the guy who recorded* Eric Garner's murder?
740,1,guilty,Bothom Jean case witness was shot and killed
741,1,guilty,what happened there?
742,1,guilty,"Here you go! https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18253848/eric-garner-footage-ramsey-orta-police-brutality-killing-safety

743,1,guilty,"Ah, the good old 120 on Richmond Terrace. Thats the precinct where a cop in a marked car called me over to him to show me that he had his penis in his hand when I was around 16. 

No surprises here for me."
744,1,guilty,"&gt; precinct where a cop in a marked car called me over to him to show me that he had his penis in his hand when I was around 16. 

I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS! Wait, I don't. I know what to say.... WHAT THE FUCK?"
745,1,guilty,"It was 1978 or so. 

You do know that the NYC cops used to rape us queers on the regular, whether we were male or female , cis or trans, right? You do know thats whats at the crux of what precipitated the Stonewall riots, right? 

This cop tried to molest me only nine years after Stonewall. Right there on Richmond Terrace, in front of Borough Hall, next to the precinct. 

NYC cops are corrupt as fuck, they always have been."
746,1,guilty,"I remember while he was in jail, the guards rat poisoned his food."
747,1,guilty,Yeah the article in there mentioned it pretty gruesome.
748,1,guilty,And the other people in his block.
749,1,guilty,"I love that they were able to raise so much money for him, but that will never replace the years lost or the mental scars from years of torture"
750,1,guilty,Like that one guy in Texas who was a witness in a murder trial against a cop. The cop got put away.... and he ends up randomly murdered soon after.
751,1,guilty,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Botham_Jean#Controversies_involving_witnesses

For anyone that doesn't know what he's talking about."
752,1,guilty,"Fuck, I always do that."
753,1,guilty,"why not reference the actual case?.... this wasnt just that one guy in texas, this was a massive national trial... the man youre referencing was a witness in former police officer Amber Guygers trial after she killed Botham Jean who was sitting in his apartment eating ice cream and watching TV, when she walked into HIS APARTMENT, off-duty, and shot and killed him, gave zero medical aid/did not attempt CPR, and later claimed that she thought she was walking into her OWN apartment, which was a floor above Jeans apartment. the witness who testified against her was found dead shortly after the trial, and the explanation that was later given was that he was a victim of a burglary by three men and was fatally shot, and the supposed three perpetrators/burglars were later arrested."
754,1,guilty,"Domestic partners of cops have a hell of a time getting free of abuse.

Literally. It's fucking hell trying to escape."
755,1,guilty,And the trauma she will live with the rest of her life knowing she made all the difference despite standing right there. The agony.
756,1,guilty,"She literally had the best course of action she could have taken. She couldn't have intervened without getting hurt/killed/arrested. At least this way, she wasn't in harms way and was able to bring justice"
757,1,guilty,"I can see that video being one of the most important pieces of media from this century. It's something that wouldn't have been able to be captured before the mass proliferation of mobile phones, and the quality of the video was remarkable. I know it pales in comparison to the trauma she's facing, but I hope she can at least go to bed at night knowing she did all she could, and captured what I think will prove to be one of the most influential moments in American history."
758,1,guilty,Absolutely but she still testified that the guilt from not doing more keeps her up at night. Trauma doesn't just go away because you did the right thing. All the witness testimony was so powerful
759,1,guilty,Sad but true.
760,1,guilty,Not all heroes wear capes. Some just use a camera phone
761,1,guilty,"Keep your phones charged, kids."
762,1,guilty,Also install the ACLU app which streams straight to their servers in case police confiscate and destroy your phone.
763,1,guilty,"Kids is right. She was 17 at the time, walking with her 9 year old sister. Both testified at the trial. I hope they have a good support system to help them heal. Watching a man murdered by police in front of your eyes has to be extremely traumatic."
764,1,guilty,"There are tons of George Floyds out there getting killed that don't have the benefit of all this evidence.  
  
Things really, really need to change."
765,1,guilty,I. Thinking of all the George Floyds in the past who didnt have a bystander video
766,1,guilty,"Now that this is done, we look towards the future to prevent this from happening again."
767,1,guilty,Keep filming
768,1,guilty,Hell yes. And film even harder when some nervous cop tells you hes gonna arrest you for some obstructing bs.
769,1,guilty,Ignore them. It's your constitutional right.
770,1,guilty,Florida doing their best to undermine it though
771,1,guilty,Hopefully this is the precedent set. Cops can and will be held accountable for malicious acts like this.
772,1,guilty,"I didnt realize that. That a gross execution, too. Like, get on your knees and beg before I kill you. 

What was the reason to not show the video of the actual event?"
773,1,guilty,"Because the court didn't want it to influence the jury. You know, like evidence is supposed to."
774,1,guilty,Where are you guys getting this information? The body camera footage *was* admitted into evidence. The judge just didn't allow it to be broadcast by the media.
775,1,guilty,Daniel actually lived in my hometown at the time of his murder. He was on a business trip for a pest control company. Nobody there said anything about him when he died. Not a peep. Maybe in the local newspaper which I dont read (most people dont around here). But there were no rallies. No protests. Nothing. Just silence.
776,1,guilty,Daniel Shaver was the worst cop shooting Ive ever seen
777,1,guilty,"Watching gruesome shit never really affects me at all.

The Daniel Shaver video made me fuckin nauseas"
778,1,guilty,yeah truly fucked. poor guy was begging and complying. so terrible.
779,1,guilty,"I cant watch that one. Ive seen a lot of fucked shit in my life but knowing how that cop got away, and is currently getting paid 2500 a month for murdering a man pisses me off so much."
780,1,guilty,The cop who killed Mr. Shaver execution style and then claimed the incident gave him PTSD should never be allowed within fifty feet of a firearm ever again. The easiest way to ensure that would be a prison sentence. And none of that cushy protective custody either. Throw him in gen-pop.
781,1,guilty,"did you know he got his ""You're Fucked"" gun back? After he claimed PTSD, he asked for and was given his gun back."
782,1,guilty,"Yes, I did know that and it sickens me. It makes me want to vomit."
783,1,guilty,"I really had no expectation for a conviction. You're talking about a nation that produced a courtroom that agreed Daniel Shaver deserved to die because he couldn't crawl correctly while literally on his knees begging for his life before being executed isis style by the Mesa, AZ PD.

But this one was different."
784,1,guilty,"That one was another I wish I hadn't watched all
The way through."
785,1,guilty,"I watched it and I was utterly sickened at the pow we trip that Mesa was on.  He was giving orders to someone terrified out of his mind and obviously having issues with carrying out the orders.  All Mesa had to do was cover the guy until back up arrived, but nope, he decided to give confusing directions and then execute the guy once he failed to follow them."
786,1,guilty,"One correction... the guy yelling instructions and the guy that shot him were different people.  Obviously they were both severely wrong and deserve to be behind bars, but want to make sure the facts are accurate."
787,1,guilty,"The guy giving orders retired that week and moved to the Philippines and left his buddy out to dry for the crime too.


How that didnt give everyone else on the force a moment of clarity idk."
788,1,guilty,"That's up there with the brick video in the ""videos that haunt me years after watching"" category"
789,1,guilty,"Yes, thankfully this one was handled differently."
790,1,guilty,"To this day, that video will pop into my head occasionally. Cant imagine the fear he must have felt, and the anger his loved ones experienced if/when they watched it. 

The police are meant to protect and serve. Hold them to a higher standard. Bravo Chauvin jury for doing the right thing."
791,1,guilty,"That was probably the worst police brutality video I watched. He deserved justice. Scratch that, he deserves to be alive."
792,1,guilty,Still dont understand how that happened.
793,1,guilty,"The police somehow made it so the prosecution couldnt show the footage of his murder in court (they only released it after their man had been cleared of murder), AND prevented the prosecution from producing the rifle with YOURE FUCKED written on it 

They then went and rehired he to give him a medical discharge for PTSD and a fat pension most of us would kill for (pun not intended)"
794,1,guilty,Yeah that video will haunt me forever. I will never understand how that cop got let go.
795,1,guilty,"The Daniel shaver one is the one that always sticks with me. The video is fucking gut wrenching. A dude who posed no threat, laying face down in a hallway and was just drunk is literally begging them to not shoot him. And they shot him five times"
796,1,guilty,"~~A reminder that the jury didn't get to see the video of Shaver being murdered.  They only got to see the literal second  before he was shot, not the 10 minute game of Simon says that proceeded it.~~

I was mistaken.  I use to defend that jury and now I hate that I have. What the fuck is wrong with them?"
797,1,guilty,"No, they saw the full, unedited video. What the judge didn't allow was the prosecution's wish to show a slowed-down version of the actual shooting.

Which makes that outcome even more infuriating. They weren't, however, made aware of the ""You're Fucked"" dust cover on his AR-15; the defense somehow managed to convince the judge that was prejudicial."
798,1,guilty,[Guess I misremembered](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa/2017/10/26/jury-sees-body-cam-video-ex-mesa-officer-fatally-shooting-unarmed-man/803368001/).
799,1,guilty,Im happy to see more and more people talking about the Shaver case.
800,1,guilty,Body cams should be mandatory for police
801,1,guilty,"Mandatory body cams that don't mysteriously ""malfunction"""
802,1,guilty,If there is no body can footage police statements should be inadmissable in court.
803,1,guilty,"They absolutely should, but even so, they can just turn them off."
804,1,guilty,Turning it off on duty should be no-questions-asked fireable offense.
805,1,guilty,I remember reading that some were programmed to continue recording after they were turned off. Bless those devs =O<˝
806,1,guilty,"They still are. They loop record and if someone turns it off then it auto saved the previous 25 seconds and continues for another 30. 

I remember a high profile case out of Baltimore where the officer plants drugs in a guys car and shuts his camera off. The full video exonerated the poor dude they wrongfully jailed"
807,1,guilty,Thats another example of why we should normalize the idea that a cops word is not necessarily more trustworthy than a civilians.
808,1,guilty,Start wearing body cams as citizens for more angles against this bullshit. 5-0s malfunctions wont matter that way.
809,1,guilty,His peers and superiors also threw him under the bus as well.  That is probably what helped convict Chauvin.
810,1,guilty,Yeah. Not one cop supported him. They helped the prosecution. Its about time.
811,1,guilty,"Only took the worst race riots in 30 years happening all over the country to convince them. I think, unfortunately, this isn't going to be indicative of the sea change we all want."
812,1,guilty,"The blue wall of silence actually showed some cracks. Other cops NEVER testify against their own, this is a HUGE development."
813,1,guilty,Sacrificial lamb for now.
814,1,guilty,"Yep, unfortunately this is all strategy, instead of morals. More likely than not"
815,1,guilty,"Well, the crime was grisly and couldnt really be argued as humane.  It didnt have the legal wiggle-room like, for example, what happened with the Breonna Taylor case."
816,1,guilty,"Film every interaction with a cop.

Every. Single. One. You never know whether you're going to get Officer Friendly or Officer McShooty."
817,1,guilty,"Darnella  Frazier, the teen who took the video, is the hero who made this possible.

She had the presence of mind, and steady hand to film it all. To document and watch.

I have read where she has said that she felt she didn't do enough. I hope that today she fully realizes that she did more for justice in America on that day than most of us will do in our entire lifetimes.

I can't imagine the horror of watching a man die like that in real time. I would want to look away. I am thankful she didn't. 

It wasn't adult prosecutors who really made this possible. It was a 17 year old who knew what was wrong, and did what she could with no power but that of the camera on her phone. She made Black lives matter."
818,1,guilty,"&gt;steady hand to film it all

This. The fact that she didn't drop her phone, didn't swing it around wildly, that it just stayed trained on Chauvin and George. That allowed the key expert witness, Dr. Martin Tobin, to count out the last 8 breaths George Floyd took, then pointed at the exact moment Floyd's face changed from life to death. That was the most powerful few seconds of testimony in the entire trial for me, and I'm sure it really shook the jury too."
819,1,guilty,"That was so powerful. What was even more powerful was that with that analysis, the prosecution could say exactly how long Derek Chauvin kneeled on George Floyds neck while Floyd was already dead."
820,1,guilty,"Yup! Was struck by that. Just quoted it in another comment and will add it here

&gt;""The knee remains on the neck for another 3 minutes and 27 seconds after he takes his last breath""  
&gt;  
&gt;""The knee remained on the neck for another 3 minutes and 2 seconds after we reached the point where there was not one ounce of oxygen left in the body""  
&gt;  
&gt;""After there's no pulse, the knee remains on the neck for another 2 minutes and 44 seconds""

Tobin's such a boss."
821,1,guilty,I'm fucking white and it's still frightening knowing that there are people like this with a badge and a gun that could kill me and then get help from their buddies to sweep it under the rug. Sincerely hope that this is the beginning of real change.
822,1,guilty,"Tobin is indeed a boss. Also, this jury was one for the ages. Pretty well educated, and able to take the science in, and that's not always easy in America. Kudos to them, and juror 19 as the foreperson. There was a lot of weight riding on their shoulders."
823,1,guilty,Jesus tho. That moment where he came back to dispute to Carbon monoxide BS and there was a side bar. I thought he said too much and blew up the whole trial. So nerve-racking!

This is the beginning of the moment in Dr. Martin Tobin's testimony where he points to Floyd's last breath: [https://youtu.be/AK1CfYLTwZA?t=15352](https://youtu.be/AK1CfYLTwZA?t=15352) (yellow arrow in the 0.3x speed video)

827,1,guilty,Just ridiculous that this cop was such a monster
828,1,guilty,"I wonder what he did that might? Did he sleep? Was it restful? I would feel horrible, or I that I would feel horrible if I killed someone."
829,1,guilty,"Ive wondered this pretty often since it happened. I struggle to get to sleep after a stressful day at work, and I know thats probably not healthy. But the weight on my shoulders is pretty far from murder. How did this fucking guy manage to sleep at night?"
830,1,guilty,"I didn't pay attention to the trial because I knew it would just enrage me. I never heard this detail, and my blood is boiling. After hearing those statements and the one someone else added, about the officers themselves not finding a pulse, I don't understand how any jury could justify a vote of not guilty. I am honestly shocked it even took them as long as it did, there is no conceivable way this could have been anything other than murder. The only ones mad at this ruling are racists and cops who will begin to finally be held accountable for their bullshit."

838,1,guilty,"Yeah. I hope shes in therapy at least. Therapy should be a normal part of our healthcare routine anyways, right up there with the suggested bi-yearly dentals. So much more having to witness someone die so cruelly and have your name known to the world at such a young age."

840,1,guilty,"What's so sad about all of this is that man, this is a cathartic moment for a whole community but fucking hell, the bar is so damn low that when a cop murders someone and they ACTUALLY get convicted it's seen as this monumental moment."

866,1,guilty,I remember watching that video in the late 2000s because I was to young to know what was happening when it happened.  Its awful and even with the graininess you can clearly see whats happening.

889,1,guilty,I'm actually surprised he was found guilty on all counts. I'm shocked.
890,1,guilty,Murder 2 was a small stretch. Murder 3 and Manslaughter 2 were foregone conclusions. Getting all three is a huge victory.
891,1,guilty,"Can any lawyers here explain to a Brit how you prosecute 2 murder charges and 1 manslaughter charge, on 1 death please?"
892,1,guilty,"It should be understood as charges in the alternative: the jury found that the prosecution had proven the elements for all three of the offenses. Hell be sentenced on the basis of the most severe charge, not all three separately.

Convicting on all three means that, even if the second-degree murder charge is overturned on appeal, the lesser charges would stand (unless the grounds for appeal also affect them)."
893,1,guilty,"&gt;Hell be sentenced on the basis of the most severe charge, not all three separately.

No, he'll get sentanced for all convictions, but might serve the 3 sentences concurrently rather than consecutively"
894,1,guilty,Under Minnesota Statute [604.041](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.04) you can't be sentenced with a lesser offense of the same crime. He'll be sentenced for the charge of second-degree murder and the charge of second-degree manslaughter. The third-degree murder charge is basically there just in case the jury had ruled not guilty on the second-degree murder charge and as the comment above stated in case the second-degree murder charge is successfully appealed.
895,1,guilty,"When you charge someone with a serious crime, it includes all lesser crimes. That way if you can't prove intent, for example, you can still prove negligence and serve justice. Someone doesn't get off the hook just because they committed murder, but it wasn't exactly as bad of a murder as it could have been (ie, Murder 2 instead of Murder 3)"
896,1,guilty,"This is how it should be done

Occasionally you get a dumbass prosecutor like the one in the Casey Anthony who fails to do lesser includeds, because they're so damn sure they can prove intent, annnnnnd so they get off scott free anyway."
897,1,guilty,"It's basically the prosecutor telling the jury they can choose from an array of charges. They all involve death, but varying degrees of intent and negligence.

Edit: I'm not a lawyer, I've just seen prosecutors ""accidentally"" lose enough high profile cases by only bringing a single high profile charge instead of multiple tiers.

My guess is he serves the sentences concurrently and they convicted on all three because he can appeal specific charges and this makes it more likely that something sticks, no matter what."
898,1,guilty,"Thanks for the reply, if he is convicted of all 3, does he get the punishment for all too, or just the heaviest sentence from the 3 charges?"
899,1,guilty,"The sentences often run concurrently, so essentially the heaviest sentence."
900,1,guilty,"Grateful for the outcome, but wont this have the criteria for years of appeals?"
901,1,guilty,"Sure, but during that time he will be in prison."
902,1,guilty,"Usually concurrent sentences, so essentially just the longest one."
903,1,guilty,"~~Heaviest sentence, if I understand correctly.~~ Judge's discretion, apparently. The jury essentially said ""yes, his action met all three of these laws' descriptions."" ~~But it's only one act so he gets the harshest punishment of all 3 options.~~

I imagine it also means if one conviction is overturned for some reason, the other two still apply."
904,1,guilty,The judge gets to decide if the sentences run concurrently or consequtively
905,1,guilty,I was expecting not guilty for second degree murder but guilty for third and manslaughter.

Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction

May 25, 2020 (MINNEAPOLIS) On Monday evening, shortly after 8:00 pm, officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded to the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South on a report of a forgery in progress.  Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence.

Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car.  He was ordered to step from his car.  After he got out, he physically resisted officers.  Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.  Officers called for an ambulance.  He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.

At no time were weapons of any type used by anyone involved in this incident.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has been called in to investigate this incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department.

No officers were injured in the incident.

Body worn cameras were on and activated during this incident.

The GO number associated with this case is 20-140629."
939,1,guilty,"Jesus.  Some r/agedlikemilk material with that statement (that the PD put out, just to clarify)."
940,1,guilty,Yeah he died of a medical incidence that was created by Derek Chauvin cutting off his oxygen; they left that part out tho
941,1,guilty,"Guilty all 3 counts... was not expecting that, but holy hell does that feel good."
942,1,guilty,"This is one case, one human being. But I am so glad DC was held accountable today - George Floyd deserved justice. As a Minnesotan, Im glad the jury got it right.

And it felt really good to watch DC get escorted out in cuffs."
943,1,guilty,"Idk why it's political, it's fuckin murder. I work with people that are flipping the fuck out, why is this even up for debate?"
944,1,guilty,He looked shocked but okay until his bail was revoked. Thats when it got real.
945,1,guilty,In a couple hundred years historians are gonna look through this thread and be so confused why people are defending Derek Chauvin.
946,1,guilty,"Again many lives ruined because of stupidity. Chauvin and the other cops should have just taken Floyds info and passed it on to the detectives. One man dead and another in jail over a possible counterfeit $20. I have in my life had at least 4 counterfeit bills, one was handed to me by a bank teller, as I counted the money it felt different and I walked right back to the teller and showed it to her, she took it and said sorry and gave me a new one. I would bet there are hundreds of people on Reddit right now with a counterfeit bill in their wallet."
947,1,guilty,"People are saying theyre surprised of the fast verdict... Surprised about what though? It should have been fast and trivial, the guy literally knelt down on someones neck for 10 minutes straight and suffocated them as they pleaded saying they cant breathe.. all on multiple videos."
948,1,guilty,"I have never seen, up close, someone being slowly and obviously killed whilst an onlooking public film and plead for reason. So many people watching and asking for mercy. This fucking idiot doesnt realise anything is wrong, or pretends to not realise. He deserves the worst. Forgot to mention that he is a cop: of all people"
949,1,guilty,That video was literally watching an execution. He was afraid of someone handcuffed and unconscious and remained afraid when there was no pulse?
950,1,guilty,"If you think you can perch on someones neck with your entire weight for nine minutes+ and not expect to become a murderer because of it, you are delusional."

968,1,trumpCovid,"The countdown is basically a ""head's up"" for NBC's [affiliate stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBC_television_affiliates_\(by_U.S._state\)) (some of whom may be airing their own programs, like local news and such) that there will be a special report, and that they should take the network feed.

Other networks, such as CBS, have countdowns as well. [This is from 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eTzV7HvKHU) - note the first ten seconds.

Whether the viewer sees the countdown depends on how quickly station master control switches to the network feed. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't."

984,1,trumpCovid,Are the alligators on meth? If so then sold
985,1,trumpCovid,"Theyre Floridian. Which means its a cocktail of meth, crack, and whatever pills where in my grandpaps medicine drawer.

991,1,trumpCovid,So what happens if he gave it to Biden? What if they both don't make it to election day?
992,1,trumpCovid,"Their parties would scramble for a new nominee. Probably Pence and Harris, but not necessarily. It would be unprecedented for both parties to lose their candidates a month before the election so who knows. I mean, a ton of people have already voted, so would those votes carry over to the new nominee for that party?"
993,1,trumpCovid,"I saw someone post on another thread that your vote is for the electoral college representatives, so in theory its up to the party to decide who the actual candidate would be in that case. Not sure if thats accurate or not...."

1030,1,trumpCovid,"I do work in social media marketing. Social media is far too important to let someone just post off the cuff all the time.

Most likely all the tweets are written by staffers and driven by Daniel Scavino (Communications &amp; Social Media Director).  Theres analytics that would have a lot of information about his base from every post he makes. What works to motivate people, what doesnt work.  We use this data to drive our sales strategies and I have little doubt that most these politicians do the same.  You track the response of every post and see what people want more of and feed the audience what they are looking for.

Dan Scavino accidentally posts on his own Twitter.
https://i.imgur.com/SGhRO4v.jpg

I actually dont believe Trump submits any of his tweets himself. I highly doubt he cuts clips from live interviews and posts them himself.  Social media marketing is a lot of work with a lot of data and plays a huge influence on public perception. Even what seems like the dumb trivial stuff is all pre-planned and executed with a goal."

Even in the debates Trump talked about how safe it was and if Biden was a lower person he definitely would have said 'why don't you ask Cain how safe he felt it was'

Instead he definitely said something that went over some people's heads imo, which is that is was safe for Trump because guess what, while Cain has tons of shoulder to shoulder photos with people maskless at the rally, you won't find Trump in them."
1035,1,trumpCovid,"To be fair, Herman Cain is still tweeting out support for Trump from the grave."

Melania Trump caught on tape saying ""Who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff?""

Trump and his wife test positive for covid.

It's only Thursday. A months worth of October surprises in one week.

*edit: To Melanias exact phrase. Here is the leaked audio of what she said: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUtHinlefIc

*edit: To those flipping out about Melania and saying what she said isn't a big deal, do me a favour and listen to the entire audio tape and then replace Melania's name with Michelle Obama. If Michelle Obama was caught on tape saying what Melania did, I'm willing to bet you would be singing a different tune."

1060,1,trumpCovid,"&gt; According to a dozen well-informed sources familiar with her complaints, the assistant alleged that Guilfoyle, her direct supervisor, subjected her frequently to degrading, abusive, and sexually inappropriate behavior; among other things, she said that she was frequently required to work at Guilfoyles New York apartment while the Fox host displayed herself naked, and was shown photographs of the genitalia of men with whom Guilfoyle had had sexual relations. The draft complaint also alleged that Guilfoyle spoke incessantly and luridly about her sex life, and on one occasion demanded a massage of her bare thighs; other times, she said, Guilfoyle told her to submit to a Fox employees demands for sexual favors, encouraged her to sleep with wealthy and powerful men, asked her to critique her naked body, demanded that she share a room with her on business trips, required her to sleep over at her apartment, and exposed herself to her, making her feel deeply uncomfortable.

And she's fugly too."

1113,1,trumpCovid,I think thatd be a really smart move. Trumps absence would linger in the viewers mind as the overshadowing covid that had such ironic effects.
1114,1,trumpCovid,I wonder if this is made up to give Donnie an out from the rest of the debates.
1115,1,trumpCovid,The rumor that they were going to mute/turn off mics when the other person was talking probably didnt excite the maneuver he pulled on the first debate.
1116,1,trumpCovid,"Please, Jesus, let us have a zoom debate where they actually mute him."
1117,1,trumpCovid,I'm imagining some comical (well comedy/tragedy) scene where he breaks out the dry erase board and starts holding up cue cards.
1118,1,trumpCovid,"Theres no way cutting his mic will slow him down. Unless theyre going to seal him in a chamber, hes just going to start shouting really loud if they cut his mic.

1122,1,trumpCovid,And more taxpayer money for a Trump business. Yay...
1123,1,trumpCovid,"If Trump dies from this his supporters will frame it as a liberal conspiracy. 

If he has a hard recovery he will fight tooth and nail to delay the election.

1124,1,trumpCovid,This is what scares me. I don't want to wish a shitty recovery upon Trump but I feel the consequences of him going through an easy recovery are astronomical.

1167,1,trumpCovid,Bad things happen in Philadelphia
1168,1,trumpCovid,My general rule of thumb is that if donnie tweeted it then it's probably a lie.
1169,1,trumpCovid,Their team probably figured this is the best way to get out of having another disastrous debate for him without any suspicion
1170,1,trumpCovid,"I'm betting they're lying.

My bet is they're going to double down on the hoaxer conspiracy theorist appeal and lie that he had a positive test, then say ""it was a false test"" to sell the narrative that the numbers are inflated. Then he'll pull a Bolsonaro and say he got it then got better then got it then got better a dozen times only mere days apart.

Either that or he'll lie that he had it, but was fine because of the hydroxychloroquine since there are obvious conflicts of interest there."
1171,1,trumpCovid,"My first thought too; this news gets them past the tax debacle, the debate debacle, and keeps him from having to show up to any more debates... then he gets to shake it off as if it's no big deal and the left wingers are being hysterical."
1172,1,trumpCovid,Im kind of concerned that he doesnt actually have it and will use it as a way to promote some random drug or to tell people that it isnt really that bad.
1173,1,trumpCovid,My first thought as well.
1174,1,trumpCovid,"Oh thats a really interesting point. I was thinking that it might be a way to try to postpone debates  and/or the election itself, but I think if he can get himself out of legal trouble that would be his first priority."
1175,1,trumpCovid,"I definitely worry that hes making it up to either 1. Delay the election, 2. Get out of the next debate, 3. Use his zero symptoms and speedy recovery to prove that the dems were totally pretending this was serious and its just the common cold!!!, or 4. All of the above."

This is a plot twist I expected for so long, that I kind of stopped expecting it, so I actually am surprised it happened today, although I shouldn't be.  


Edit: This got so many upvotes so fast. To reply to you tinfoil hat wearers. The timing does appear a little convenient. This is gonna cancel/postpone the debates, or make it so they are done over skype. However, I don't think Trump would fake a virus he will barely acknowledge exists. That move is too desperate. He isn't gonna play up the virus he failed to manage, a month before an election. Also, This is gonna cancel some of his key rallies. No president is gonna give up their ability to throw rallies for several weeks in October. I think he's really got it."
1202,1,trumpCovid,"Same. Back then it seemed like the virus was going to hit him soon, after it got CPAC. It took you long enough Corona-chan, but you finally got him."
1203,1,trumpCovid,"It hit Cpac, and there was some party at Mar-A-Lago.

Assuming Trump survives Covid, I wonder what his stance will be on the disease in a few weeks."
1204,1,trumpCovid,If he survives he would be like I have the best immune systems. The virus is not a big deal at all. Keep America Great! Were fucked
1205,1,trumpCovid,"My biggest fear is that he is asymptomatic and uses his own experience to leverage his coronavirus policy. See, its just the flu! As 100 million Americans remove their masks"
1206,1,trumpCovid,"When Bolsonaro caught it, he used it to promote hydroxychloroquine and say he ""was the living example it worked"". Absolutely expect it to be leveraged politically"
1207,1,trumpCovid,Oh if Trump overcomes it he for sure use that as an example of how he has the best of genes and his followers will believe him
1208,1,trumpCovid,I feel like anyone who would remove their masks if Trump turns out to be asymptomatic has already done so by this point.
1209,1,trumpCovid,"exactly, i was in a rural area recently, stopped by a gas station and was the only one wearing a mask,(had to hit the atm put one on to go in the gas station) I even had someone mock me putting their hands over their face pointing and laughing.

1211,1,trumpCovid,"These buffoons unironically wearing shirts that said ""better russian than democrat"" kinda already outdid the Borat trailer."
1212,1,trumpCovid,I mean regardless hes likely going to say he was asymptomatic and has the best immune system of any president ever so....
1213,1,trumpCovid,"or he dies

 which would be the ultimate leopardsatemyface or leopardateitsownface in this case"
1214,1,trumpCovid,"Well shit. Along those lines, he could be lying about it entirely just as a comeback stunt to resurge in the polls....with an added benefit of getting him out of any further debates. We are SO fucked."
1215,1,trumpCovid,100% that is what will happen.
1216,1,trumpCovid,"Infowarrior theory:  He's faking it so he can get better and wax on about his superior genes.

edit:  Also as an excuse to bonespur his way out of the next debates."
1217,1,trumpCovid,"Despite him calling it a hoax and dismissing masks, the WH has had some of the strictest controls in the country. he has a dedicated steam that follows CDC guidelines to the letter and more, that constantly sanitize everything and send out teams to sanitize when he travels before he gets there.

everyone need him gets constant testing, and anyone seeing him regardless of testing has to pass a temp check.

Its actually kinda amazing he did get it, especially since he has worried that if he ever got it, it would undercut his message that it is disappearing and everything should reopen.

and yeah he goes maskless to rallies but everyone is far from him.. and he went maskless to manufacturing plants, but everyone else was in masks. and im sure everyone was tested before he came."
1218,1,trumpCovid,"Our odds are a lot better. How many people do you come in contact with on a daily basis? Compare that to how many Trump must come in contact with, and then go 6 degrees of separation out. 

Also, if you've been smart about it and have been protecting yourself, the chances are higher that the people you come in close contact with have been just as smart about it. On the other hand, if you've believe that it is all a hoax, the chances are pretty high that the people around you think so too. If so, good luck. 

And, it's not too late to start making smarter choices even if you previously thought Covid was a joke. Wear a mask, social distance, and if you still manage to catch it, I wish you a speedy and full recovery."
1219,1,trumpCovid,"I mean, not to get all r/conspiracy BUUUUT he could also not have it and be leveraging this as a publicity stunt. He got hammered about his COVID approach at the debate so by having it and beating it he positons himself as an authority on the matter.

Edit: Granted, if it was a hoax would they have done the whole Hope Hicks thing first? And include Melania? If you have a conspiracy you try to control it as much as possible and not include lots of variables. So who knows?"
1220,1,trumpCovid,"I felt the same way about the shooting outside the WH during a presser when he acted so calm.

1221,1,trumpCovid,"You're almost there, this is his way of getting out of the election without everyone watching him lose."

Id be happy to correct that assumption should it be disproven."
1227,1,trumpCovid,Also concerned he'll recover (because by nature of being the president he'll get the best care possible) and claim it's all really not that bad...
1228,1,trumpCovid,"Yep, out of the debates and proves it only affects losers"

1233,1,trumpCovid,"I agree, I'm not fully convinced this isn't a last ditch ploy by him to try to get support after easily ""surviving"" it, and meanwhile being able to skip debates. I need confirmation from people who are not in his circle that there's actually evidence he's sick."
1234,1,trumpCovid,"Watch his public schedule. A man in a catch-up race for a second term does not take days off unless he has no other option. He will have the best medical treatments available to him, not Hydroxychloroquin."
1235,1,trumpCovid,THIS !!! - Trump will play the I beat coronavirus card
1236,1,trumpCovid,Exactly this. Look at how ideal the timing is - a nice big distraction from the fact that he refused to denounce white supremacy and now he doesnt have to debate under tighter rules.

1252,1,trumpCovid,"For those who unable to open Sam Vinograd's thread (some key points):


&gt; This is a code red moment for the U.S. government.


&gt; We don't know exactly where Hope Hicks contracted #COVID19 but her diagnosis sends the message that the @WhiteHouse wont do whats necessary to protect its own staff which logically furthers the narrative that they arent willing to do what it takes to protect us


&gt;I lived through H1N1 at the WH. @BarackObama (and his senior staff) advised all personnel to follow guidelines and to be as cautious as possible because he cared about our health and because he knew what an outbreak would mean for national security.


&gt; A pandemic in the west wing is a worst case scenario. Immediately, critical resources will be diverted to mitigate any outbreak at the most senior levels of government.


&gt;Second, crisis mitigation will likely include quarantines. This means that key WH staff will not be able to fully perform their jobs, access classified servers, and more. We won't have a fully functioning team on the field.


&gt; Trump's irresponsibility has put himself, his family, his staff, the functioning of our government, and millions of Americans at unnecessary risk."
1253,1,trumpCovid,This [video from the debate of Trump ridiculing Biden](https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1311839895921467393) for wearing a mask didn't age well.

It's funny though it was one of the most memorable parts of the debates. People are instantly going to remember that when they hear that trump tested positive. The man talks so much shit and does it so stupidly that it's constantly getting blown back onto him."
1262,1,trumpCovid,He was trying to insult Biden by basically saying look how hard youre working on your image.  Why Trump thought the image of being safe was something to make fun of is a mystery to me
1263,1,trumpCovid,"You're giving him too much credit. He's wasn't thinking that far. It was him calling Biden a pussy and that's it; the same type of infantile, petty insults he's been making his entire life."

1268,1,trumpCovid,"Oh, this will be far worse for him. He can't go to his rallies. He needs those rallies. They're the syringe in his arm and they're filled with the cheers of his base. 

This is going to drive him so far into the deep end. 

I don't wish ill upon him or any person, but I will read of his discomfort with great pleasure."
1269,1,trumpCovid,"While I agree with this sentiment, won't he have access to world class doctors? Medical supply shortage, insane medical bills, etc won't apply to him and the people of the white house. I'm no expert but I won't be surprised if he pulls through just like how I'm not surprised he got it in the first place"
1270,1,trumpCovid,"Oh he most certainly will, but he also is in awful shape. Only time will tell what happens, but the president getting hospitalized for a disease he said was no big deal right after already dipping in the polls could be disastrous.

Having said that, VOTE. No matter how things look, you must VOTE, absolutely no one can guarantee how this election will turn out, every vote is essential to getting rid of this stain on American democracy."

1314,1,trumpCovid,He's fat and old. He might die from this.
1315,1,trumpCovid,Nah hell get lucky and dodge serious symptoms and then spend the next month downplaying it.

1355,1,trumpCovid,I wouldn't have felt sorry even if he hadn't mocked Biden. He's mocked enough other people for their reasonable responses to the virus.
1356,1,trumpCovid,"More importantly, he handled the country's response to Covid-19 very poorly."
1357,1,trumpCovid,This sure did wake us up when September ended
1358,1,trumpCovid,Good thing we have billions of hydroxychloroquine pills for him to consume.
1359,1,trumpCovid,"I have so many thoughts and yet IDK how to feel.  This is the state of how jaded I have become:  I honestly wondered, ""how long could this administration actually keep the president dead without any of us finding out?""  I remember it being discussed when he was rushed to Walter Reed as well.

This is scary and a sad moment for this country.  This man is 74, overweight, and has contracted a virus which has killed 200,000+ Americans in less than a year.  7+ million are carrying it.  We have no full, real medical report about what his true baseline is health-wise.

And an election in 32 days.  **Biden is not out of the woods yet from the debate from what I understand.  And where is Pence?**

A virus that he has largely denied, fueled conspiracy theories toward, was just mocking mask-wearers at the most recent debate, has gone against public safety recommendations to not have these insane tightly-packed rallies, and has failed to encourage Americans to take even the most basic public safety precautions to protect yourself, and care for your fellow American.  WHAT THE FUCK ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN?!  So much recklessness for what purpose?!

And depending on WHEN they found out about Hope Hicks, and Trump still went to a fundraiser tonight--WTF is happening with his planning team.  And if he stays asymptomatic - is he going to push past this quarantine early and demand life get going again?

But I tell you, its weak. Its a weak virus and the Democrats will tell you its so morbid and does all sorts of nasty things. Its not true. But my blood is pure. I had a headache, a mild one, thats it. Thats all it was. The fake news said I would die. Joe Biden would die, he would die if he had it, like his weak son. But I didnt. I dont know what happened to Melania, you have to ask her, but Im sure shes fine. Lets get out and vote."
1361,1,trumpCovid,"Plot twist:  Trump was contagious during debate. Gave it to Biden. Trump survives with no issues. Biden dies.

1) They actually have it...

2) They don't but this is a hail mary sympathy play...

3) They don't have it and this is so he doesn't have to appear anymore ( no debates / no press briefings / nothing) until after the election is over.


I'm leaning towards 3..."

4. Pretending to have it, and recovering quickly to show how healthy he is"

1376,1,trumpCovid,Hell wriggle out of more debates and then crow about being so strong against the COVID virus thats a hoax anyway.
1377,1,trumpCovid,"I guess that means no debates in the near future... 

What convenient timing after such an abysmal first debate."
1378,1,trumpCovid,Zoom has a mute button...
1379,1,trumpCovid,"My first thought was that he's not actually sick and this is just a good way to avoid having to do anymore debates.

Edit: Thank you for the gold, kind internet stranger!"
1380,1,trumpCovid,"&gt;My first thought was that he's not actually sick and this is just a good way to avoid having to do anymore debates.

And then say ""see, it wasn't even that bad"" when he ""recovers."""
1381,1,trumpCovid,"My second thought is he doesn't really have it and is just saying he does so he can tout his incredible genes when he miraculously recovers.

I mean I'm not saying that but other people are /s

Edit: btw he was just hosting a private fundraising dinner near my hometown suburb in Minnesota. Only a day after the debate, he was courting the suburbs. $100,000 a plate (this price is purely what I heard from a friend who lives in the same neighborhood). 

Imagine paying $100,000 to dine with the president and then get coronavirus.

Edit 2: GO VOTE! 

For those curious he was met with mixed reactions. He does not have the suburbs on lock. Plenty of rich people out here that don't want him. That's why he's out here. Don't lose hope. Your vote counts.

1384,1,trumpCovid,He will demonstrate the power of bleach and hydroxychloroquinine!
1385,1,trumpCovid,I wonder if Pence was exposed to either of them
1386,1,trumpCovid,"He has the ""Bolsonaro"" strain of Covid, the kind that doesn't really exist that you can leverage politically."
1387,1,trumpCovid,Have you seen the recent photos of Bolsonaro though? Like if anyone looked like they had covid 5 times in the past year it'd be him.
1388,1,trumpCovid,So youre saying that Trump will look like he has low energy?  Frail and weak?  Thats a shame
1389,1,trumpCovid,"This gives them a chance to steer the conversation away from his blatant fascism for a little while, gives him a pretext to avoid the next debate, and then gives him a chance to talk about how its just like a mild flu."
1390,1,trumpCovid,"Yeah this is exactly what I was thinking. 

I don't think anyone should be celebrating Trump having it, either he dies, which may cause utter chaos (imagine the conspiracies...), or he recovers and uses it for leverage which is also bad. 

My only feeling is concern.

edit: oh fuck it, I've been on twitter, I'm now laughing my ass off"
1391,1,trumpCovid,"If hes quarantining, he wont be on the campaign trail during early voting.  Thats a huge win.  He wont be able to rally for Senators or House candidates.  This is pretty big.  

Fake or not.  Even the simple fact hes saying hes quarantining is a kick in the head to his cult followers.  It destroys one of the illusions."
1392,1,trumpCovid,"Nah, he needs the debates to gain ground on Biden in these last few weeks. Plus, have you ever known Trump to turn down the opportunity to talk to the camera on a stage as big as this?"
1393,1,trumpCovid,"Same. And then hell be fine and can boast about being strong and its no big deal, hoax blah blah blah."
1394,1,trumpCovid,I didnt even think of this... would definitely not put it past him
1395,1,trumpCovid,"This is the very first thing I thought of and it will absolutely happen. Hell have it mildly, as most people do, and it will become fuel for those who think its no big deal, including himself."

1403,1,trumpCovid,"You got me thinking, hypothetically if they both pass away from Covid, what even happens right now? A lot of ballots have already been cast. Does it become a Pence vs Kamala race, or do the parties nominate someone else?"
1404,1,trumpCovid,"Copied: Here's a real answer: It depends on when it happens.

There are 3 important dates: the date of the popular vote (Nov 3), the date of the electoral college vote (Dec 14), and the date the electoral votes are counted (Jan 6).

* If the candidate dies prior to the popular vote, the party selects a new candidate and everything continues as normal.
* If the candidate dies after the popular vote but before the electoral college votes, the party still picks a new candidate for the electoral college vote only. There isn't another popular vote. The electoral college votes normally but with the new candidates.
* If the candidate dies after the electoral college votes are counted, succession rules are followed. The VP would be inaugurated.
* If the candidate dies during the time between the electoral college vote and the vote count; however, it gets weird. Congress decides if they want to count the votes for a dead candidate. In the past they have invalidated those votes. If they count them and he wins, succession is followed and the VP is inaugurated. If they don't count them and no candidate wins the majority, Amendment 12 says the House must then hold a vote where each state gets one vote and must choose a candidate from the three candidates with the highest electoral college votes. If the House vote fails to get a 2/3 majority, ~~around March 4~~ January 20 the current President is succeeded by the current Vice President."

1444,1,blizzard,"Under new EU laws you can also demand they send you the data they have on you, and if they fail to respond in (i believe 30?) days, they're subject to massive fines. 

This is a much better strategy than people in the EU deleting their accounts.  If even a fraction of people do so, it may very well overwhelm their ability to respond to requests, which would subject them to extraordinarily huge fines.  And you'll get your data, which is great, because if they're owned by, and subservient to, an authoritarian dystopian nightmare like China, it would really benefit you to see the dossier they've accumulated on you.

[This article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee) has some info about the regulation. 

**EDIT:**  [A commenter below has provided an excellent form letter](https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35dslz/) people can send to Blizzard requesting specific types of personal data.  This is really great.  I know Blizzard has disabled their automated system, so it would be worth it to print this out and snail mail a copy to Blizzard HQ.  

**EDIT**:  [Another commenter details the inanity of complaints that people utilizing this law will somehow ""get it taken away](https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f35o74c/)

A lawyer or legal expert int he EU should weigh in here on how exactly people should go about doing this though.

**EDIT:**  People have said they can file for an extension if they are backlogged with requests.  I've heard 2 months of extra time.  I would say that's fine.  They can't just *not* fulfill the request.  

Keep in mind the GDPR are new laws.  The EU may be looking to make an example of companies, and may come down harshly on Blizzard for non-compliance, especially given Blizzard's stance on Hong Kong and them going to bat for China.

**EDIT**:  Additional people are claiming (without citation) that courts would throw these requests out because they were organized.  I would like someone with knowledge of the legal system in the EU to weigh in, but I am extraordinarily dubious about this.  For one, Blizzard would have to prove each request was legitimately ""malicious"".  For two, laws aren't usually chucked out the window because it's ""hard"" for companies to comply.

**EDIT**:  Naysayers keep insisting that utilizing an existing and unambiguous law is ""abusing"" it.  I would say that authoritarian China owning a 5% stake in Blizzard and Blizzard taking a clear stance in favor of authoritarianism and suppression and treating advocacy for Democracy as hate speech represents an extremely urgent need for everyone in the EU to figure out what data Blizzard is accumulating on them, and then delete it to ensure it does not fall into the hands of monstrously murderous authoritarian regime. 

That's why the law exists in the first place.  Insinuating they will ""take it away"" *if you use it* is absurd.  

And if it turns out that the requests are easy for Blizzard to field, then the worse that happens is you took five seconds to get your personal data and now know what Blizzard accumulated on you and can make the informed decision whether or not to delete your data. 

That's a good thing.  Every person on Earth should have unencumbered access to the totality of what corporations are accumulating about them online.  It's your data, not their property.  

**We do not live in fear of corporations.  We do not owe them the courtesy of making their lives easier.  If they can skirt existing laws because those laws are ""hard"", then we know the laws need to be strengthened.**

**EDIT:**  A lot more HailCorporate people here then I would have ever expected. 

It's really interesting that so many people are so concerned for the welfare of massive companies and so sympathetic with their plight to hand over personal data they collect on their users.  They're very upset that mean people would dare to abuse the law by simply requesting that data. 

There is, of course, a really easy way companies could comply, instantly, with these requests: *stop compiling and reselling user data*. 

Blizzard doesn't *have* to stick a tracking device on me and monitor every other website I go to after I visit them, log which games I play for how many hours, log my buying behavior on their loot boxes, sequence my genome to determine my suscpetibility to dopamine slot machines, and so on, and it certainly doesn't need to bundle that data and sell it to the highest bidder.

They could just, I dunno, make good games?"
1445,1,blizzard,"Holy shit I wish I could do that here in the US.  Like seriously, there are some companies that I *really* want to get this information from."

1447,1,blizzard,i believe the phrase you're looking for is *cries in american*
1448,1,blizzard,"Gotta vote first, then mayyybe"
1449,1,blizzard,CA passed a consumer protection law in which and request your data be removed or not shared. Something along those lines. I think it goes into effect 2020.
1450,1,blizzard,"As a DPO, I can confirm, this is a brutal request if you don't have this stuff automated."
1451,1,blizzard,"Uk here. Haven't had an active account since 2014. Time to send a GDPR request to see what they hold on me.

We EU brehs are on it"
1452,1,blizzard,This is beautiful. Bravo
1453,1,blizzard,"I really like the way you're thinking.

This should go viral."
1454,1,blizzard,"It may be too late for people to see, but I have a few important comments for the idiots who think a law - particular this law - would be removed if we use it or that it would not be worth the effort.

1. Laws cannot simply be removed. There is a legal process. In the EU, the general legislative process is long-winding due to the EU's nature of offering a framework for member states to find common laws. Ever tried to make 27 people agree on anything? Now try nation states. Once they agree on a law, that *stays*.

2. In this spirit, the GDPR is one of the EU's poster childs. It will never be repealed. The entire EU's strategy is to set itself up as the guardian of your digital rights, and export this regulation. This is not only done for scoring domestic points, it exemplifies our best means to assert control over non-domestic industry. This is [a geopolitical strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect), not some random law.

3. The new Commission for the next five years is being put through parliamentary inquiries right now. Vestager, the same woman who took on the digital giants as competition commissioner, will be the minister equivalent (= here, vice president) for the digital single market &amp; competition. As stated earlier, GDPR is not only one of her main weapons but a weapon she helped craft. A high-profile case such as HK is a godsend for the EU, which generally has a hard time doing PR.

In conclusion: if Europeans decide to use GDPR - which we should! - then the EU Commission will unequivocally stand behind a law it itself wants and needs. Anybody telling you otherwise just showed you how ignorant they are of the entire process, or how well-paid for spreading disinformation."
1455,1,blizzard,"Excellent post.

You're right, there's no way the EU would roll back GDPR."
1456,1,blizzard,"Yes, everyone do this."
1457,1,blizzard,"We need our own GDPR. ""I hope the EU does it for us"" is a shitty solution."
1458,1,blizzard,Please someone in Europe test this.
1459,1,blizzard,Their mostly sleeping at this time. They will start waking up in a few hours.
1460,1,blizzard,bring forth the europeans
1461,1,blizzard,it is foretold
1462,1,blizzard,"Ugh I just got up, what do you need us for this time?"
1463,1,blizzard,Im european but I can't sleep
1464,1,blizzard,"Ok, I found 2 Europeans. But admit most of your neighbors are not currently browsing Reddit."
1465,1,blizzard,"What they're blocking is the ability to actually delete your data.  You can stop payment subscriptions, but they're denying people the ability to actually fully nuke their account because they're hoping they can stop the bleeding, wait a week and then everyone will forget."
1466,1,blizzard,"You can still cancel subscriptions/payments, you just cant delete your account rn."
1467,1,blizzard,"Which may be a violation of the Article 17 of the GDPR. 

Try a VPN and use a EU based IP, then try to delete."
1468,1,blizzard,I'm curious if that'll actually work or if their heads are so far up their asses they couldn't see this coming...
1469,1,blizzard,"If you are in Europe, pursue GDPR complaints."
1470,1,blizzard,"Ive been trying to get mine deleted since this started, they still havent approved it. Which is ridiculous that I need approval to close my own account."
1471,1,blizzard,I wanna quit the gym!
1472,1,blizzard,Make multiple tickets until the GM's permaban you for harassing them.
1473,1,blizzard,"They said i had to open a support ticket and i HAD to send them a picture of my photo ID to cancel my account.

I thought of two things...

1.  They dont know what the fuck i look like, so what does that prove?

2.  Isnt there a law or something protecting people from this kind of scrutiny...

Oh wait...  They supported China.  I should have expected that.  I sent them a photo of my middle finger as my ID.

Edit: go figure.  They denied my request because it wasnt an adequate government issued ID"
1474,1,blizzard,Requiring a government ID to delete an account that didn't require one sounds super fucking bullshit and possibly litigable.
1475,1,blizzard,"I just tried and ran into the same thing. Didn't proceed because I'm at work and I don't have my ID on me ...

Why the fuck do they need my ID to delete my information??? I'm not affiliated with them in any way and the closest thing they have to any kind of sensitive information is an expired credit card.

What kind of totalitarian ass backwards garbage is this??? Wouldn't sending them a PICTURE of my ID give them more information on me than they already have? What a fucking joke"
1476,1,blizzard,"Same thing happened to me, reminds me of the BS facebook tried putting me through to 'deactivate' my account. They required a drivers license or some form of ID to even begin the deavtivation, not fully deleting it. I'm not giving them that info to *potentially* 'delete' my account so I just logged out and never logged in again. That was a few years ago"
1477,1,blizzard,Don't ever send your personal identification to a business unless it's mandatory for the services they render by the local laws.
1478,1,blizzard,Isn't that illegal in the EU?
1479,1,blizzard,Very much so. This will be a death knell for Blizzard in the EU. Corporations can not just do as they please here.
1480,1,blizzard,Must be nice.
1481,1,blizzard,I mean it's technically illegal in the US as well if they don't let you cancel an account if it has your payment info. But no one will do anything except your bank blocking the company if you ask.
1482,1,blizzard,"That is shady as shit, and illegal surely because of data protection?"
1483,1,blizzard,"What the fuck? How does that possibly help them in any way? Sure, itll keep their numbers up a little, but now the narrative is something far worse."
1484,1,blizzard,The numbers are all that matter for the people behind this. Thousands of Chinese accounts plus imprisoned US accounts equals $$$
1485,1,blizzard,Same here and oddly enough my 16 year old son who loves overwatch uninstalled last night . I haven't said a thing about this in front or around him. Happen to ask him why and he said because of the banning of the player and what's happening in Hong Kong.
1486,1,blizzard,Congratulations dude... youve obviously raised a thoughtful young lad there ... well done :)
1487,1,blizzard,Proud parent moment right there
1488,1,blizzard,"Ive been following this and am pretty disheartened as my friend and I were looking forward to re-experiencing Azeroth as it was. Last night we had a deep discussion about ethics and reasonable responses to something of this nature, be it from a company, product or even family member you are attached to. In the end its just a game and not worth supporting over such foul actions against human dignity. 
I started a small but growing guild at Classic launch. I had high aspirations for it. This morning I drafted a resignation letter to let my guildies know my and my officers intended actions. Id just like them to be informed and not dust them without explanation.
I fully support the employee walkout and vandalism of the now hypocritical statues and plaques on their campus."
1489,1,blizzard,This is my buddy continuing to play overwatch after the rest of our group uninstalled lmao
1490,1,blizzard,"Same, uninstalled Hearthstone the second I heard about this shit"
1491,1,blizzard,"Same here... fuck /r/Blizzard.

EDIT: Just to add.. when I tried to delete my account, it falsely said I wasn't entering in the right SMS code, or email code, or even answering the personal questions properly. Thankfully the authenticator app code worked but yeah, they didn't make it easy. They also say it can take 'days' to remove everything."
1492,1,blizzard,"Not even that worked for me (https://i.imgur.com/LGnuEgY.png). Both SMS and Authenticator failed citing too many attempts despite this being my first one.

Ended up submitting a ticket asking them to delete the account since uploading an image ID just seems... yeah, no."
1493,1,blizzard,When me and Marco Rubio are in agreement then you really fucked up
1494,1,blizzard,NBA and Blizzard want China's money
1495,1,blizzard,"I wouldn't be at all surprised if this is what opens the floodgates and causes companies to start taking sides. [Red Bull already has](http://reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/dfma0w/red_bull_sided_with_hong_kong/). The amount of damage this has done to Blizzard's reputation is huge, and other companies aren't going to want to follow in their footsteps."
1496,1,blizzard,"Similarly, the NBA debacle has [AOC and Ted Cruz](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/china-nba-dispute-legislators-condemn-league-for-betrayal-of-american-values/) drafting letters together.

What a fucking timeline."
1497,1,blizzard,"If everybody had phones, we wouldn't be in this situation. /Blizzard"
1498,1,blizzard,Also they fired the people who interviewed him. Just because they let it happen.
1499,1,blizzard,"""Just because"" is enough of an infraction in China..."
1500,1,blizzard,"Everyone needs to understand the CCP is the biggest enemy to human freedom going forward for the next 100 years, the earlier the better to get at them."
1501,1,blizzard,"People really underestimate how fucking brutal China is.

Which is weird because they're known mostly for atrocities like strapping people to tables and removing their organs without anesthetic.

Blizzard also has a branch in Taiwan, so not playing ball with China also puts those people at risk. The commentators were unfortunately doomed no matter what Blizzard did in this situation."
1502,1,blizzard,"I got pretty strong hunger games vibes from that, anybody else?"
1503,1,blizzard,"Straight up my first thought, did that literally happen in the hunger games?"
1504,1,blizzard,"It's funny because that's the part that really bothered me. Dont like what he said? Fine. Want to suck your chinese overlords along, do you. Take the dudes earned prize money, well I suppose I dont want to play your games anymore. Refunded Warcraft 3 Reforged last night."
1505,1,blizzard,"It's just a dick move. The guy played fair, he won, he deserves the prize. Blizzard instead gave him the financial middle finger and kept their prize money to themselves. Just dirty, who can support that?"
1506,1,blizzard,"I wouldn't be upset if he had say done it during the actual tournament, but it was all over.  Technically the game rules don't really apply anymore.  It was a **post game interview**.  Blizzard has no right to punish a player for what is said in an interview."
1507,1,blizzard,"Yeah, I mean if he stood up in the middle of the play and just screamed ""viva la revolution"" and disrupted play, I mean, I get it.  It's less about the sentiment and more about him ruining the action and the tournament. 

But, why even bother interviewing someone if you don't want to hear what they say?  It was two sentences and it wasn't even *derogatory towards China*.  I mean he didn't say ""fuck China,"" he had a positive message for Hong Kong.  I would probably leigtimately support Blizzard if he said, ""fuck China fuck Xi.""  I *agree* with that sentiment, but a post-tourney interview is not the time to say that. 

But a pro-Democracy message that doesn't even mention China?  Which upsets China because *they're trying to revoke the rights of the people of Hong Kong through military force because they're assholes*? 

Burning his entire season and livelihood to the ground for *that* is well beyond ""rules"""
1508,1,blizzard,"Between this and the HOTS professional player drama (they shut off the competition without telling anyone), this should be a wake-up call to other players: if they want to make a career out of it, don't go to blizzard."
1509,1,blizzard,"Delete your Blizzard account: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/2659

No single game, no single company, is worth becoming a lickspittle to China's regime."
1510,1,blizzard,Seriously. It's not even petty. A foreign country silencing companies and people in our own? And blizzard is playing along? They can fuck right off.
1511,1,blizzard,"Yeah, this isn't like they made a game decision people didn't like, it's them literally (and blatantly) siding with a regime that is actively perpetrating serious human rights violations.

They could've played hands-off by just giving him the equivalent of a slap on the wrist, but no, they went 100% all in on China's side."
1512,1,blizzard,I want to but they demand a pic of my ID and I'm not giving that to them.
1513,1,blizzard,Feels shady as fuck to have to give them that information
1514,1,blizzard,"So who else, is going to Blizzcon cosplaying Winnie the Pooh?"

1516,1,blizzard,"Well I definitely won't be going to Blizzcon. Mostly because it's in the other side of the country and I'm broke, but also because of this."

1522,1,blizzard,"Apparently, Winnie the Pooh cosplays are banned and anyone attending the event wearing it will be asked to change or leave. I don't know the legitimacy of this claim though. 

I wouldn't put it past Blizzard though, ""you think you do but you really don't""."
1523,1,blizzard,Just wear tan pants and a red t-shirt. They can't really tell you to not do that.
1524,1,blizzard,Why not?
1525,1,blizzard,Because thats not a cosplay. Though they can impose a dress code that prohibits outfits vaguely resembling Winnie the Pooh.
1526,1,blizzard,Who is going to Blizzcon? Everyone should try to get a refund on their tickets even if it takes a chargeback to do it.
1527,1,blizzard,This is the correct course of action.

No, this is offensive to THE GOVERNMENT of China."

Boo-fuckin'-hoo. It's so lame."
1538,1,blizzard,"Yeah, the CCP always says it hurts the feeling of the 1.4 billion people in China but they're not even being elected by the people. How could they think they can represent all the 1.4 billion people?"
1539,1,blizzard,"Any time a government or politician of any type conflates themselves with ""the people of the country"" it makes me a bit sick."
1540,1,blizzard,"Regardless, if some people being free hurts your feelings, your feelings should be hurt."
1541,1,blizzard,"Theres a saying in Hong Kong its as if they have hearts of glass. 

Boo fucking hoo."
1542,1,blizzard,"It's the Glass Heart.

A very interesting cultural facet that's been cultivated over the decades that's for sure.

Sadly my country is owned by the CCP, so we can't influence our politicians much."
1543,1,blizzard,The government of China who is pushing to squash what little actual voice the Chinese people have in their governance. I'd say it's offensive to humanity to not back the people of Hong Kong.
1544,1,blizzard,"For most people there are no realistic ways to do that, but thankfully Blizzard has provided everyone a convenient target."
1545,1,blizzard,Who would've ever thought Hero 32 would be the Blizzard staff?! Proud of you all!
1546,1,blizzard,"I've read that working for Blizzard is a pretty shit gig, the main advantage being bragging rights. Well now it's not even a cool bragging right. Can't say I blame them for walking out."
1547,1,blizzard,"Used to be good, I'm friends with a former employee.  She knew the guy who had to give the Diablo immortal introduction, and we were sitting together at blizzcon when he did it.  She felt so bad for the guy.  Blizzard threw him to the wolves."
1548,1,blizzard,Thats fucking brutal.
1549,1,blizzard,Wow its pretty sad that they kinda knew what was gonna happen and still let the man go on
1550,1,blizzard,"Lower to the ground employees will have, but those at the top could very well have been so disconnected as not to have realised. Similar to Gearbox and G2A fiasco. Top brass are likely completely disconnected."
1551,1,blizzard,Anyone whos ever talked to board members etc. for a major company knows how hilariously out of touch and clueless they can be. Wouldnt surprise me if they were lied to by their yes men and were shocked by the reception.
1552,1,blizzard,"Yep.  You will find no greater table full of fools and arrogant imbeciles than at most board of directors. 

They will force awful ideas on you and then blame you for the terrible consequences of those ideas a year later."
1553,1,blizzard,"Being a Director sounds like an awesome job.  Just show to a meeting every few months and get paid $100,000 per meeting."
1554,1,blizzard,"Not all boards are bad. When you have a board that is mostly made up of shareholders wanting to increase all profits it's going to be shit.

Looking at their board, they should have more members and more diversity. Get a member or two from the community in there, some more mid-level employees, people that can speak to what's going on first-hand in other areas ActiBlizzard impacts. Rely on their expertise."
1555,1,blizzard,"While this isn't a defense, it's incredibly hard to get anyone below you to report bad news, or give you criticism. 

I mean, how often have you heard one of your boss's plans been like ""My God that's a stupid idea', and when they've asked you, you've been like 'Yeah, sounds good to me!'"
1556,1,blizzard,"There's a great scene in Sillicon Valley, which is one of the most accurate depictions of business life I've ever seen, where a massive project is in turmoil, and no one at the company will tell their superior about the full extent of the problems. 

So the result is they release the product and it's a complete failure. 

But what I'll add to this is that the C-suit and the managers are responsible for setting the culture.  It is critical that they establish a culture of opennness and transparency, so that they are not blindsided by anything along the chain."
1557,1,blizzard,"Are you kidding? I've never had a boss who didn't immediately respond to bad news with a lecture about my attitude and the suggestion that by not being a team player I wasn't suitable for advancement or even continued employment. As far as your boss is concerned, it's your job to make their terrible ideas successful, and when you do, they get all the credit for the success."
1558,1,blizzard,Oof I just looked up the video.  AWKWARD
1559,1,blizzard,"Tbh this is what I kind of assumed at the time. Imagine being a Dev being psyched to start a new Diablo game, but instead you work with a shitty Chinese company to make a crappy Diablo skin of an existing game. Then instead of hiring actual, professional speakers or PR team they make you go out there awkwardly to try and sell an idea that you know is going to go over poorly."
1560,1,blizzard,"Wyatt really got put in the shittiest position. He basically saved the Diablo 3 series, and was forced to make the announcement that he knew was going to be a disaster. His comment about not having phones didn't help at all, but I feel awful for him."
1561,1,blizzard,"I've defended Wyatt in so many of these threads and never seen anyone else doing so. He's been a valuable member of the Diablo team for a long time.

Seeing the community go after him so harshly over a lighthearted joke that didn't land.. such a terrible look."
1562,1,blizzard,"I feel bad for anyone that got hired into Blizzard when they started basically no longer making real games anymore; all these people on these projects are probably crushed that THE games company they dreamed of working for basically... Doesn't exist anymore, at least, not in the capacity that they had been told it would / expected it to."
1563,1,blizzard,What I dont get is if blizzard was such a cash cow  why not just let the creative people take the reigns and let them do whatever the hell they want? The fuck does a shareholder know anything about besides being shitty people? Suck a dick shareholders!

1567,1,blizzard,"I saw in another thread that Riot is owned by Tencent which is essentially an arm of the Chinese govt. I know that doesnt add much to your point but I thought it was interesting. 
Seems hard to avoid the CCP."
1568,1,blizzard,Tencent has part ownership in many many American companies.
1569,1,blizzard,They own 40% of Epic... so watch out fortnite streamers! big china watching.

1571,1,blizzard,"Considering Tim is the CEO and majority shareholder, he can do whatever the hell he wants. And he's siding with freedom of speech."
1572,1,blizzard,went back to riot is like the biggest warning sign here. Riot is a known shithole for a looooong time
1573,1,blizzard,"Theyre all bad. They can afford to be bad to their employees because of how many people really, really want to work for a major game studio. You dont like the work environment? Then they replace you."
1574,1,blizzard,"I've heard the same thing about some other game companies like Wizards of the Coast. Idk about Blizzard, but WOTC is alleged to pay below industry standards hoping that people want to work for them out of love for the games they design rather than for the money. Basically they are hoping new hires are big enough of a nerd to give up the pay they should recieve in return for the opportunity to work on their favorite card/tabletop game."
1575,1,blizzard,I interviewed for a Sr UI designer position at blizzard and they were only paying 70k which is 20k less than I was making at a local small business in socal. I was pretty disappointed.
1576,1,blizzard,"Yeah that seems to be the standard. They hope that your love for OW, WOW, HS, SC or Diablo mean you will take sub-standard pay."
1577,1,blizzard,"That's how the gaming / hobby industry is in general, especially for the more popular companies. There's a large amount of competition for a small amount of jobs so they don't need to pay as much as less 'fun' jobs. Working for the company is a 'benefit' that's priced into the salary.

The brewing industry is similar, there are always hobbyists who want to do it professionally."
1578,1,blizzard,What does Hero 32 mean?

1602,1,blizzard,"~~Blizzard gets 12% of its revenue from China~~, (CORRECTION: Blizzard gets 13% from the total asia-pacific market, China is likely around 5% of Blizzard's revenue) and gaming is discouraged in China via losing social credit score, so it's not really close, Blizzard would certainly pick the western market."
1603,1,blizzard,"That's incorrect, Blizzard gets 13% of it's revenue from Asia - China may be as little as 5% or less of their total revenue.

If they choose which audience is larger it's easily other countries and not China. When you realize that you start to understand just how awful this is. They're not even siding with the majority of their customers...so what exactly is happening inside Blizzard?"
1604,1,blizzard,"&gt; They're not even siding with the majority of their customers...so what exactly is happening inside Blizzard?

well, based on other companies:

1. they want to keep *all* sources of income
1. they gambled on the fact that this will ""blow over""

Now, no one here is argueing greed but this will be interesting to see if people *do* actually let it blow over or continue to boycott blizzard.

Gaming boycotts have been largely failures and blizzard is extremely huge in comparison"
1605,1,blizzard,"If this was after blizzcon then I'd bet on this blowing over. But we have blizzcon on the horizon in November and that's just ripe for some serious drama if blizzard doesn't fix all of this before then. 

The collegiate hearthstone event already had a team holding up a sign on their camera after a match. How much worse is blizzcon going to be?"
1606,1,blizzard,"Ya i boycotted blizzard because a female friend of mine worked there, was sexually harassed, then fired when she complained and told it was her fault for putting her self in that situation...

So i immediately stopped playing Overwatch and didnt think twice about WoW classic.. 

But i realized Activision and Blizzard were like the same thing, and i had been playing BlackOps for half a year. It was rough but i stopped playing that and now only play Apex and ESO..  if blizzard owns either of those imma be super annoyed.  f blizzard. F Activision."
1607,1,blizzard,"&gt; Ya i boycotted blizzard because a female friend of mine worked their, was sexually harassed, then fired when she complained and told it was her fault for putting her self in that situat

hold up...this is against workplace laws.

she can sue.

like this is actually pretty serious. In australia some mid level business got ripped apart for this - its as bad as being fired for race"
1608,1,blizzard,"&gt; What they tell you and what they record as the official reason to justify termination are very different things. 

Must be a US law thing then. Because that doesnt work here or else everyone could fire anyone for stupid stuff like ""being late on monday"""
1609,1,blizzard,"Some states in the US have employ/fire ""at will"" laws, which basically means you can fire an employee for any reason, or sometimes for no reason at all"
1610,1,blizzard,"They didn't think the backlash wouldn't be this big and won't last long, kinda wanted to have their cake and eat it too. Hopefully people keep this going to show Blizzard and other companies that siding for China just because you want more money isn't right and won't work."
1611,1,blizzard,"Can I speak as someone with some insider knowledge?

Blizzard overall gets around 13% of it's revenue from the asia-pacific market, this is true. But don't confuse how that revenue is distributed between games. 

World of Warcraft accounts for the largest part of blizzards revenue, but this is only like 40% at most. When we're talking about the money itself, we need to look specifically at hearthstone. What is undeniable is that hearthstone generates up to 50 million dollars a year roughly. This goes up and down, but the asia-pacific market, makes up about 65% of all their sales in hearthstone. 

This is not something you can just ignore, while it's a small portion of the overall sales with wow making up a good chunk and overwatch filling in a decent balance, hearthstone literally lives and dies on the asia-pacific market. Card games in general do not exist in the western market. I speak about this as someone who has worked in the industry for decades, and who makes a living on what works and doesn't work. 

Rule of thumb is that if it's a card game and it's not target at the asia-pacific market, it is not worth even a cent, and not an ounce of attention. Most mobile rpgs are the same way. What works in the western market? match 3 games and builders. That's where the money is at in the western market. 

You have to think logically about how it's divided. 5% of total revenue overall for blizzard is from china, but like 40% of hearthstones total revenue comes from china alone. That is not something you just disregard and throw away. 

This is not defending blizzard at all, the way they handled this was appalling and they deserve every bit of backlash."
1612,1,blizzard,"The Western audience is still definitely larger though. And richer.

If Blizzard has to pick only one, theyd obviously pick Western, I dont see how anyone could dispute that.

This is just them attempting to thread the needle and keep both audiences."
1613,1,blizzard,"But now it's up to the consumer; continue to support a company that proved they don't give a fuck about it's customers or boycott the fuck out of this company until they go out of business.

I know which side I'm on. I'll never give Blizzard another penny, I wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire."
1614,1,blizzard,"Around half of Blizzards income comes from North America, with Europe being their second highest. China *currently* isn't a big market, but they are hoping that 10 years or so from now it will be much more lucrative. If they abandon their north american clients now, they won't survive to reap their investment into China."
1615,1,blizzard,You would be surprised at how indifferent wed be. Weve already mourned old blizzard. Modern blizzard would not be missed.
1616,1,blizzard,"The crossroads has been passed. Did you see [the message](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfjldg/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/) out of Blizzard's Chinese Weibo account?

Seriously, how did these fucking cretins think that this would work? First of all, their families and their relentless purchase of properties have caused a housing crisis in Vancouver as rent and real estate prices have skyrocketed, so they do not realize that Vancouverans (is that the proper pronoun) already have a reason not to like them. 

Second of all, they tried displaying ostentatious wealth because, in their minds, it would display how prosperous China is, not realizing they look utterly ridiculous and are a public nuisance, and probably also not realizing that most of their parents' wealth has absolutely nothing to do with China. Hell, their parents were doxxed by Chinese nationals who couldn't fucking believe how their kids were driving Ferrarris, McLarens and Lamborghinis. These kids are too stupid to realize that they are much richer than your average Chinese national and that only CCP government officials have that kind of money.

Third, the great irony and hypocrisy is that these braindead farts don't realize that you absolutely couldn't pull this shit in China, how they'd likely be all imprisoned, and that, have their parents stayed there, they wouldn't drive Ferraris &amp; Lambos.

Just a bunch of fucking idiots showing national pride for a country that they haven't been in, will most likely never go, and that their wealth has absolutely nothing to do with China, and that their parents wouldn't achieve such kind of wealth if they haven't immigrated out of China.

Looks like you cant delete your Blizzard account now XD

I don't deserve Gold or Silver for this (but TY!). 

Just re-post of a re-posted tweet I saw from an awesome YouTuber (If you game, gotta check out his reviews, A++ quality):  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9\_x1DImhU-eolIay5rb2Q](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9_x1DImhU-eolIay5rb2Q)"
1649,1,blizzard,I'm in the EU and they denied my request using all forms of identification including a picture of my passport. They're very obviously blocking people from leaving so there's no visible drop in user numbers that could be used against them. They are fucking cowards. GPDR complaint incoming! https://imgur.com/3KKnOw0.jpg
1650,1,blizzard,"They also cancelled my two requests beforehand, so I had to go down the *gov't issued photo id route*. https://imgur.com/mOYfvJi.jpg https://imgur.com/EBoFbJQ.jpg"
1651,1,blizzard,"There was a comment further up explaining that EU citizens can request their data from Activision Blizzard, and if they dont comply within 30 days, then they would get fined. If enough people did it and they werent able to comply to them all then they could get hit with some pretty hefty fines."
1652,1,blizzard,Is there anything that prohibits Blizzard from verifying an id like this before deletion? I have heard of other places having similar requirements.
1653,1,blizzard,Its not a small fine either... its a massive fine that hurts.  I work in compliance handling gdpr and that shit is no joke
1654,1,blizzard,"To all EU citizens:

Here is a list what you have to include into your deletion request:

I have no Blizzard account else I would send it to them too. Let's flood them with this and see where it goes."
1655,1,blizzard,Yeah I cancelled my 3 month wow sub that I had 1.5 months left on and asked for a pro-rated refund for it. They refused despite having done this for me several times in the past when something came up preventing me from getting my money's worth. Pushing back on that currently.
1656,1,blizzard,"&gt; Please contact Blizzard support for assistance.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; Regards, Blizzard Support

Can't make that shit up."
1657,1,blizzard,I believe that's illegal in the EU.
1658,1,blizzard,"Correct, GDPR regulations require companies to delete an individual's personal data if so requested.  Potential fines are up to 4% of a company's world-wide revenues or ¨20 million...whichever is higher."
1659,1,blizzard,Based on their stock filings SEA is about 12% of their revenue. And people speculate China accounts for about 5% (of the 12%) so the ultimate irony is if that 5% goes up in smoke from GDPR fines.
1660,1,blizzard,"Incidentally, 4% of revenue is almost as much as they make from their presence in China, which is 5%."
1661,1,blizzard,I assume for each individual who tried to delete their account and couldn't?
1662,1,blizzard,"That's a good question.  No EU country has levied the maximum penalty, although they have the right to do so.  Theoretically they could levy a penalty for each offense, yes."
1663,1,blizzard,"Ya, saw many people on twitter mentioning that. But it might not be illegal here in the US."
1664,1,blizzard,"If they did this in the EU, then it doesn't matter. US companies need to follow European laws when doing business in Europe."
1665,1,blizzard,"Is that even legal? Or can you close an account so you stop paying, but it's not fully deleted?"
1666,1,blizzard,"I've seen a lot of people on Twitter mention that it is illegal in the EU through something like the ~~GDPA~~ GDPR (not sure the name). Not sure if it's illegal else where, such as the States. Also, I think Facebook does this too. You never delete your account, just deactivate it."
1667,1,blizzard,"&gt; can you close an account so you stop paying, but it's not fully deleted?

You can cancel your WoW sub without deleting your account.

Not allowing people to delete their personal data is illegal in Europe under GDPR. However, GDPR doesn't actually require companies let people do it through an automated system. If you email them and they follow through within 30 days, they've complied with GDPR. (Most companies have just chosen to create automated systems to save the customer support hassle.)

If someone in the EU emails them asking for their account to be deleted and they *don't* comply within 30 days, they've violated GDPR and can face *huge* fines."
1668,1,blizzard,"Good for them. 
   
A software  company boot licking the number one software pirating country is as dumb as supporting their tyranny."
1669,1,blizzard,It's as dumb as humans who live in a free society pandering to China because money. All the money in the world won't do you any good once you've lost your freedom.
1670,1,blizzard,The people who have the money aren't going to be the people who lose their freedoms.
1671,1,blizzard,"Even the very tiny handful of people at the top of the pack aren't actually free in a society like China's. If they don't play their own roles properly, the people directly underneath them will be only too happy to destroy them and take their position by force.

See: Winnie the Pooh's rise to power."
1672,1,blizzard,"It's absolutely amazing how Blizzard *itself* blew this whole thing up, with how they handled one minute on some stream that the vast majority of people would never have known of.  

They could've simply said: ""hey, this is against the rules, whether we agree or disagree with your message we need to enforce the rules or people will do whatever they want."" and then given him a slap on the wrist. Like a month or two of suspension and a warning that if he does it again they'll throw the book at him.

*And this would not have been a story, at all.* It probably would not have even registered in other ActiBlizz communities, let alone been a thing to people completely outside of gaming. Yet - thanks to their intense, burning desire to suck up to the CCP now EVERYONE knows about it.  
Even more people are now aware of all the vile shit China does, thanks to people linking stories about China's human right abuses under every Blizzard/China post on all the social media. And it's now very obvious that Blizzard is full of shit when they claim to support human rights (as they did with LGBT stuff). They don't. They like to say they do when it costs them nothing, but they don't.

Well done, Blizzard. You failed to protect your chinese overlords and you failed to protect your image.

You truly, fully, thoroughly played yourself."
1673,1,blizzard,"&gt; ...highly object the expression of personal political beliefs at any of our events...

Okay, fair enough...

But then,

Okay, what the fuck. Sounds like they'll be okay with personal political beliefs as long as those beliefs don't butthurt China or are in favor of China.

Come on, make your rules apply equally to everyone. If you wish your company and your events to be apolitical, then you don't have to defend anybody's ""pride and dignity"".

Edit: I just want to mirror Kibler and state that I am no expert on the intricacies of the geopolitics between China and HK. However, I am bothered by Blizzard's hypocrisy by pretending to be apolitical, while being very pro-China."
1674,1,blizzard,Seriously. How far up China's asshole do you have to be to be a Western game company and be THAT willing to publicly suck China's dick over a single stream.
1675,1,blizzard,China buys a lot of fucking mircotransactions
1676,1,blizzard,"It isn't the absolute dollar amount right now, but rather the growth. Western markets are mature, so growth potential is limited. China is a huge market with lots of growth potential. Activision/Blizzard is doing this because they don't want to miss future revenue growth in a huge market."
1677,1,blizzard,China is like one tenth of Blizzard's revenue.
1678,1,blizzard,Do you think that blizzard cares more about people or 10% of their business?
1679,1,blizzard,"If they are threatened with losing &gt;10% of their Western audience to try to preserve the 10% that's Chinese, yeah, I think they'll at least feign caring."
1680,1,blizzard,Yup. The ball's in our court at this point to call their bluff. We know the bet they've made.
1681,1,blizzard,"I canceled my subscription and put in the ""reason for cancellation"" field ""Restore Hong Kong, revolution of our times (I©ô/ B„i})"" so they would know specifically that they had fucked up. if anyone actually reads the damn thing."
1682,1,blizzard,"People should start openly praising China in their streams, and see what happens. If they don't get banned, it's Blizzard not following the rules fairly. If they do, it Blizzard openly condemning pro-China speech, which would be interesting to see how China reacts."

1684,1,blizzard,Aren't they trying to turn Mei into a symbol?
1685,1,blizzard,That's the goal yeah. If it gets pushed enough people who aren't into the gaming scene might believe it and it'll become pretty bad PR
1686,1,blizzard,One of my friends said that they're doing that to try and get everything banned in China.
1687,1,blizzard,They would probably remove her from the game to appease their Chinese masters.
1688,1,blizzard,Theyre trying to pull what happened to pepe?
1689,1,blizzard,They're trying to turn a Chinese character into a symbol FOR Hong Kong in hopes that it will prompt action from Blizzard or get Overwatch banned in China. So far it's been pretty interesting to watch unfold.
1690,1,blizzard,and its fucking genius. Freedom for Hong Kong is A-Mei-zing
1691,1,blizzard,Same concept yeah. Hijack an existing symbol and reframe it as pro Hong Kong.

It's *totalitarian* propaganda.

I'm being really pedantic about this, but you can have a totalitarian system (what China's doing) under a multitude of philosophies - communism, fascism, imperialism, oligarchism, etc.

Or just mix'n'match and create your own!

Calling all totalitarianism ""fascism"" is like calling all carbonated flavored soft drinks ""Coke"", and becomes exceptionally unhelpful when trying to, say, contrast Nazi Germany, the USSR, PRC China, and other totalitarian states in any meaningful way.

Hell, someone could probably come up with a totalitarian democracy or socialist State, if they were inventive enough. Totalitarianism is about the State having unlimited control over its populace and their activities, should it choose to use it, not about how it gains, exercises, or maintains that control."

China is really thin skinned for a fucking superpower (1 of 2) for an Empire of 1.3 billion.


Chairman Xi, yes chairman his title is the same as Mao's they just force media outlets to use the wrong translation of ""president"" to make it seem like he isn't some sort of absolute ruler in the model of Mao and the other major dictators of the 20th century is try with Trump and Gollum in Turkey when it comes to being thin skinned. 



I just don't get how people and with that nations of such great power can be so petty.



Maybe for all their bluster and the party line Chinese expats and travelers parrot maybe the country is a powder keg waiting to blow and sunder."
1728,1,blizzard,"&gt; Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.

Oh. Yeah that checks out.. Fuck."
1729,1,blizzard,"Most people don't even know that the billion and a half people in China can't even see the internet that the rest of the world sees or use the social apps that the rest of the world uses. 

The Chinese live in a walled off bubble of propaganda absolutely controlled by the Chinese communist party. The nation is an absolute tyranny and has no dignity beyond the pretend ""dignity"" that slaves like Blizzard worship in return for money."
1730,1,blizzard,"That's not entirely true: many people in China have access to illegal VPNs to access the outside world, but they're usually slow and unreliable, so using facebook and other Western sites is usually not worth the trouble. But Western media (even banned media) is very popular in China.  

The real problem is that all Chinese are taught over and over about the Hundred Years of Humiliation, a period of recent history when Japan, Britain, and other foreign countries took advantage of China. Many of the facts are true, but the Chinese government pretends that China is still the victim, even though China is now far more powerful than all those countries. They like to pretend that the hundred years never stopped. That is why Chinese citizens are often very easily offended and angry.  

I see the same thing from other countries too. America believes that they have the best medical care and best schools, even though many citizens are sick or uneducated. Britain believes they are a global super power, even though they are barely relevant on the world stage. Japan believes they are the ""friendly high tech Asians"", even though their products are not that good now and their recent past is largely about war crimes. Many countries are guilty of believing lies about themselves."
1731,1,blizzard,"I have to say I agree. I said this earlier, but I am actually glad that they did this to the pro-gamer. Had they not, so many people would have continued to be oblivious about HK and about the internment camps with millions of people enslaved and having their organs harvested. 

This is bringing so much more awareness, at least to the gaming community, that there just didn't seem to be before. I keep reading people asking for links and more information and how this is all news to them. 

Blizz did play themselves, but they also fucked China making this into a bigger PR mess than it was."

1750,1,blizzard,It's not a new thing either.  They've been oppressing and  committing various atrocities against non-Han-Chinese ethnic groups for decades.
1751,1,blizzard,That's what turned my cancellation into an account deletion.
1752,1,blizzard,Stuff like that is why I think many people are actually mad at China. If all China did was be a greedy country that didn't treat international business fairly I think most people could tolerate that. But they're up to some very vile and very evil shit that goes beyond being greedy.

Sorry, but no, that isn't how China operates. We got a crystal clear view of that just a few days ago with the NBA and that Houston Rockets GM. NBA tried to go with a moderate stance and they essentially got their shit pushed in.

You either comply with China's demands to the letter, or you can see yourself out of China."
1762,1,blizzard,"Yes. This is all that was necessary.

Look, I want these venues I go to to be apolitical. I don't want stuff thrown in my face. But comments that are about issues that are important to the person being interviewed, as long as they are truthful, decent and humanitarian focused, I can just ignore.

Now I cannot ignore this because the company that provides my entertainment and I pay money to chose to side with a bully who's wants are inconsistent with truthful, decent and humanitarian - for which I cannot ignore.

Blizzcon is going to be interesting this year. Fuck you China and the greedy bastards who control the world I have to live in."
1763,1,blizzard,"Exactly this.

Blizzard didn't have to take a position here at all.

Instead they have created a situation where giving them money is giving support to Chinese oppression of Hong Kong and their human rights issues overall. They have made buying their products into an ethically problematic decision."
1764,1,blizzard,"There is nothing that's apolitical. Things only appear apolitical to those who aren't being oppressed.  When you're asking for entertainment to be apolitical, you're asking oppressed groups to, rather than beg for help, leave you alone.

The people in Hong Kong are dying for basic freedoms right now.  It costs you nothing to be made aware of that once a day. And that awareness will save lives."

So when His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso passes (he's 84 right now), there's going to be huge riots when China tries to put in a puppet.

Honestly, I know that's a shitty way for them to avoid people calling them out, but putting that aside for the moment, I do wish that more cons would use a method like this for Q &amp; A. There's always cringey or repetitive questions asked and this would cut down on it."
1808,1,blizzard,"I agree with the statement that it would help with cons, because there are usually some \*really\* bad questions, or just questions that get asked repeatedly. But how is this supposed to stop protests during BlizzCon like let's be honest. If as many people on the internet complaining about Blizzard, actually showed up to BlizzCon and started protesting or calling them out on this, they would have to just shut down the entire con, or somehow, \*somehow\* get their security to kick literally 99.9% of the people out."
1809,1,blizzard,"There is no way they cancel Blizzcon over this, that would be acknowledging that what they did was monumentally egregious and unprecedented.

 If we, as consumers, do our job they may have to cancel next year due to lack of interest."
1810,1,blizzard,"Also in the news: Blizzard salaries go up because nobody wants to work for them, so they need to lure people in with more money to offset the shittiness of enabling Chinese sycophants.

*Edit: Its been pointed out to me that the fan was being unruly and that political signs are more or less always prohibited at sporting events. Whatever the case may be in Philadelphia (do your own research and decide), it does not change the fact that Chinas influences are here. Hollywood has been afraid to show the Chinese in a bad light for years. Apple pulling the Taiwan flag emoji. Shit like this is everywhere and its becoming more and more common.

1847,1,blizzard,"There is a MUCH larger discussion than video games and Hong Kong to be had here.

China is threat to the world. They are playing the long game. They are thinking generations. And now that they have economic clout combined with a significant military, they are incrementally creeping out. 

They are making islands in the pacific out of atolls and militarizing them. They are claiming islands that belong to other nations. They are diplomatically isolating Taiwan from the rest of the world. They are doing the whole Silk Road 2 project. They established their first overseas military base in Africa recently.

They are playing a generational game. One where China slowly absorbs the world, either by might or dollar. That is their plan anyway. Forcing the world to comply with their political beliefs in our media is a step - watch South Park (the latest season in a couple of episodes) - they lay it out. 

We have to keep calling this out all the time. Corporations should be forced to make a stand. You are either for freedom or for the dollar. 

Of course, the cynic in me says no one (or not nearly enough) will change their behavior to force corporations to change theirs.

1870,1,blizzard,They'll make people submit questions in writing and have an employee read them. Otherwise it'll be chaos
1871,1,blizzard,I sold my stock on Robinhood when the news first broke. It might be small and irrelevant but I'd rather take the loss and keep myself from supporting the company.
1872,1,blizzard,Blizzard ain't got no tegridy.
1873,1,blizzard,Not a gamer but Im very interested in this story and incredibly impressed with how the community is aggressively seeking justice for this egregious wrong.
1874,1,blizzard,5% I think
1875,1,blizzard,"It's not Tencent thats the issue though, is it? It's the fact that Blizzard did this *despite* that, *despite* the lack of Chinese stakeholders - Epic Games has a 40% stake and the CEO has already made a statement that this will never happen with them. *That's* why people are so outraged.

Blizzard did this for no good reason except to get on the good side of the Chinese government so that they can keep getting money from Chinese players (by avoiding getting it banned from China)."
1876,1,blizzard,It's not about tencent ownership. It's about not wanting to be banned in china like southpark and the NBA
1877,1,blizzard,"Ive played wow on and off since vanilla, love the game. Was super pumped for classic and got to level 39. Cancelled my sub yesterday. I will resub if they admit their failure to support Democratic values and have a plan to right the wrong. Im not holding my breath."
1878,1,blizzard,"Funny how Blizzard's actions brought even more attention to the Hong Kong ordeal and also, with the utmost transparency, showed the world how greedy and heartless a group of board directors can be. 

Capitalism at its finest /$"
1879,1,blizzard,Please let all this shit be the kick in the ass some small upstart needs to make another actual good MMO...
1880,1,blizzard,"Big difference is north America actually cares about optics, where as China audience just wants mobile games. Bye blizzard. You made some seriously shit desicions under new management. Do you guys not have phones?"
1881,1,blizzard,#GamersRiseUp but actually  for serious and not a meme trololo fest and  proud humanity moment edition
1882,1,blizzard,America's capitalism is selling its freedom.
1883,1,blizzard,Cancelled my WoW subscription. Enough is enough. =$
1884,1,blizzard,"Now that's what we call a ""pro gamer move"""
1885,1,blizzard,Blizzcon this year is going to be interesting
1886,1,blizzard,"I hope this kills Blizzard

Free expression is a VERY important human right"
1887,1,blizzard,I just downloaded starcraft after not playing for five years but I guess Im deleting it again
1888,1,blizzard,"Why aren't news sites referring to this as Activision Blizzard instead of just Blizzard?

It's a joint entity now, we should refer to them both together, especially through this shitstorm"
1889,1,kobe,Leaving your house and returning safely is such an underrated blessing.
1890,1,kobe,"Damn.
Ill be thinking these words when I leave each morning for work.... going to try to remember to tell everyone including the pup that I love them"
1891,1,kobe,Even waking up every morning to a new day is a blessing.
1892,1,kobe,"Not too long ago he was pictured alongside his daughter at a basketball game and they seemed so close. She also died today. Rest in peace Kobe and Gianna.

Okay guys I keep getting some pretty fucked up messages in my inbox. If you have a problem, especially if it was because he was black, please swallow your cowardice and post it here so you can get the ridicule you deserve."
1893,1,kobe,"Kobe was once asked by a reporter something along the lines of ""Don't you want a son so that he can follow in your footsteps?"" and Kobe's response was: ""Why do I need a son? I have a daughter to carry on my legacy when I'm gone.""

Right in the feels.."
1894,1,kobe,"It was on Jimmy Kimmel:
https://twitter.com/RoFlo/status/1221547986364268545?s=01"
1895,1,kobe,"It's terribly sad. I was at that game with my brother (Dec 29 v. Mavericks) when Kobe and Gianna were courtside. The Lakers IG account posted a picture of him on the floor wearing a bright orange jacket, so we looked for him and sure enough there he was. It was a nice surprise now turned into a somber memory, considering that game was also my Christmas gift to my brother who's been a die-hard fan for over 20 years. Those tickets ended up being the last time we would get to see him (and his daughter) alive. RIP : ("
1896,1,kobe,They were on their way to a basketball game where she was playing and he was coaching. This doesnt feel real at all. Almost like in the movies when you travel to a parallel universe and find out  that some huge actor is president and everything is completely reversed. Where good is bad and up is down. I wish all of this was a dream.
1897,1,kobe,"12:35 PM PT†--†Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13.†
We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks."
1898,1,kobe,"You know what gets me... Going down in a helicopter crash must be traumatic as it is. Having your daughter next to you while it's going down, trying to comfort her, hold her, knowing this is the end. Breaks my heart =î"
1899,1,kobe,"Yeah, man. Knowing you're about to die is one thing, knowing your kid is going with you... I can't even begin to imagine. Just unbelievably sad."
1900,1,kobe,"I do wonder how much awareness they actually had. Reports were saying it was super foggy with bad visibility. They may have just started dropped with alarms going off, but had no awareness of how close to the ground they were. Terrifying to think about."
1901,1,kobe,I agree. Slamming at high speed into a fixed object is instantaneous. There was a brief (1-2 seconds) moment where the pilot tried to take evasive action. Not long.
1902,1,kobe,I would hope they didn't have to experience the panic of knowing they were about to crash (and likely die). Awful to think about.
1903,1,kobe,"If anyone had that moment of panic, however fleeting, it wouldve been the pilot. Maybe not even them, depending on the circumstances. Most emergencies of the sort, youre more disoriented than afraid, theres really not enough time for you to process the reality of it."
1904,1,kobe,"I always figure it will feel like one of the near death situations we experience while alive, except ya know, ya die this time. Your brain will be taking in so much information that you can't actually decipher what's going on.

 My brother died sitting alone in bed so I've thought about what that last moment might feel like a lot. Enough time to maybe think ""oh shit"" and then it's over."
1905,1,kobe,Sorry for your loss.
1906,1,kobe,"I dont know, man.  I had a truck pull out in front of me while going 55 on the highway with all of my children in the car.  It was seconds between when I saw the truck and when I knew I couldnt do anything more to stop it from happening.  In the moment I knew we were going to collide, I vividly remember taking inventory; I knew my children were in the back, buckled safely and would probably be okay but that I might not be.  The feeling of oh my god please dont let this be the end is like no other feeling in the world but its there and it is recognizable and it is vivid.  If I had died though, Id imagine my last moment would have been the floating, dreamlike sort of feeling that came between going out and coming to."
1907,1,kobe,"Too right.  My dad survived being shot down in a helicopter during a firefight in Vietnam (he was a door-gunner), which I realize is a totally different context, but he had nightmares about it for the rest of his life, which is just to illustrate how terrifying such an experience can be."
1908,1,kobe,"I watched the radar, they went up 700 ft extremely fast and then radar was lost. Most likely means alarm went off and pilot tried to climb through ifr but couldnt top it."
1909,1,kobe,"Commercial Pilots are all required to have instrument ratings both for fixed wing and rotary wing operations for carrying passengers for hire over 50 miles, FAA Part 61 Subpart F covers it. If LA Fire wasn't flying because they didn't meet their weather minimums for flying the Pilot here shouldn't have been either."
1910,1,kobe,"&gt; ifr

For those who don't know: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument\_flight\_rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_flight_rules)"
1911,1,kobe,"It's insane that it could even occur in a helicopter like that, the GPS systems would've had all the terrain information for the local area and they should've known how close they were, even without the terrain warnings going off. Even basic GA planes with G430's have terrain maps and terrain warnings when you're below 500ft. Even if they entered IMC, a CFIT shouldn't have occurred."
1912,1,kobe,"Average elevation in Calabasas is 928' did the fly right into a hillside.

Instrument flying is not easy according to an article a number of services had self grounded their helicopters due to the fog."
1913,1,kobe,"Flightradar24 data says that the helicopter started gaining altitude very quickly shortly before the crash. 

 [https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/n72ex#23a8271e](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/n72ex#23a8271e) 

So a pilot error perhaps..."
1914,1,kobe,Air currents can do terrifying things too
1915,1,kobe,Do we know what happened with the helicopter? How did it crash the way it did? I wonder if those on board knew they were about to die.
1916,1,kobe,"Not sure, but here is the final flight: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n72ex#23a8271e and https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N72EX"
1917,1,kobe,Will probably be a bit before all of the details come out
1918,1,kobe,"What kills me is Kobes wife, both Husband and Daughter gone in an instant, no heads up."
1919,1,kobe,"Honestly, it seems like they only noticed the dire circumstances seconds before the crash. Residents report that the helicopter seemed to be trying to go vertical, seconds before the crash. The cockpit recorder shows a sharp vertical movement which must have been scary, but only lasted 1-2 seconds before, in deep fog, they struck the hill."
1920,1,kobe,"This is likely. My grandmother survived a helicopter crash and she said they had no idea what was going on until the moment it happened. She didnt even have time to process the situation until she was eating dirt, and [her] ass hurt like hell. And this wasnt even in fog. 
Kobe and his daughter probably didnt even realize anything was wrong until the last second."
1921,1,kobe,"This may be the most accurate description....in a fog you have no way to orient yourself. 

In fog, you can't even find the horizon. And if you're not flat &amp; level when you need to be/ think you are, it's a very short flight ahead.

Gonna miss his happiness. He added much to his community and friends."
1922,1,kobe,They never knew they died.  Slammed into a hill hidden in the fog.
1923,1,kobe,"If it happened like I suspect it did, they probably never saw it coming. I know of a previous helo crash in Southern California where the fog rolled in and they lost sight of a road they were following through the mountain pass. Slammed into the mountain at more or less full speed because they got so disoriented in the fog. I hope, at least for their sakes, that it was sudden and unexpected. Otherwise yeah...the thought of going down in an aircraft and knowing theres nothing you can do to protect your child with you has to be about the most hopeless and terrible feeling in the world."
1924,1,kobe,Thats so incredibly sad.
1925,1,kobe,I can't imagine how heartbreaking it must be to lose a daughter and husband in the same accident
1926,1,kobe,Worst day of his wifes life. This is so incredibly sad
1927,1,kobe,According to official sources 9 people were on board??? =
1928,1,kobe,The daughter kills me. Thats so horrible
1929,1,kobe,"Its a tragedy, I love Kobe and knowing that innocent GiGi has to go as well just breaks my heart"
1930,1,kobe,Minus the pilot and kobe who were the other 7? What a tragedy.
1931,1,kobe,His daughter (this thread) and according to MSNBC at least one of her teammates and her parent - but I wouldnt take that as fact just yet.
1932,1,kobe,"According to ESPN, Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli was also onboard."
1933,1,kobe,and his wife and one of his kids.
1934,1,kobe,"oh my gosh

i feel so, so much for the  remaining kids. Whole world taken away from you in a day"
1935,1,kobe,"Life is cruel sometimes. Wow. Imagine being the other kids on board. Probably had this day on their calendar, helicopter ride in Kobes chopper."
1936,1,kobe,Holy shit....this is just getting worse and worse...
1937,1,kobe,"Three of them were John Altobelli (baseball coach), his wife and daughter. When I was on twitter, someone said their cousin, Christina, coached Kobes daughter, Gianna, who was on the plane. Christina was on the plane and shes leaving behind 3 kids and her husband. Thats all I know of so far"
1938,1,kobe,"It gets worse. The teammate of Gianna, teammate's father, mom AND uncle were on board.

1939,1,kobe,He legit just had another daughter like 3 months ago too
1940,1,kobe,"And just went to LeBron yesterday

Can't imagine how him and Shaq feel rn"
1941,1,kobe,"Craziest thing is Shaqs daughter Mearah is just six minutes younger than Kobes daughter GiGi, who perished along with Kobe in the accident.

It must hit even closer to home for him...

***Edited for clarity***"
1942,1,kobe,"Here is Shaqs response 

Theres no words to express the pain Im going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi &amp; my brother @kobebryant I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW"
1943,1,kobe,The fact that I can't even imagine Shaq being anything other than a bright and vibrant person makes his response sting even more.
1944,1,kobe,When his sister died a month or two ago you could see a less vibrant happy Shaq
1945,1,kobe,I agree completely. Whatever their history was they were a major impact on each other. And to just have lost that is really powerful. I was shocked about it all but when I saw what Shaq wrote it hit a lot harder.
1946,1,kobe,"My sister met Shaq in a store, and he payed for all of her things. He really is a nice guy, and that just makes it feel so bad"
1947,1,kobe,I don't think my heart could bear seeing Shaquille O'Neal cry.
1948,1,kobe,"[Link to the tweet. The pictures deserve to be seen.](https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/1221549914766954496?s=20)

Look at the pictures and videos in the comments as well, truly heartbreaking."
1949,1,kobe,"I've got a feeling Shaq's gonna hug his daughter real tight tonight.

This is such a shitty thing to happen. Kobe was just starting to enjoy settling down."
1950,1,kobe,Dude was only 41... You would think someone who has accomplished as much as he has would be way older. He was just starting his real life I feel like
1951,1,kobe,"As Obama put it in his tribute, he was in Act 2. 

It felt like his life was just beginning...enjoying his family, watching his daughters grow and trying to give back to the sport that made him who he was.

A life cut short, but what a life. 

Its the epitome of that silly quote thrown around on social media, of how it matters how much life you put in the time you have.

But still, way too young. Imagine what hed do if he lived for that much longer.

And then, imagine what life will be for his daughters who will likely live past his age having spent year after year without a dad. 

A real tragedy all around."
1952,1,kobe,called kobe daughter niece in his post :(
1953,1,kobe,It's gut-wrenching even thinking about it.
1954,1,kobe,"A friend of mine lost here ENTIRE family in a charter jet when she was 20. Three sisters, and both parent. Incredibly sad. She's one of the sweetest people I know."
1955,1,kobe,How is she doing now? I just cant even wrap my brain around that magnitude of loss; of heartbreak.
1956,1,kobe,"Yeah seriously. I don't even feel anything trying to imagine my whole family dying, seems so impossible..."
1957,1,kobe,Similar thing happened in my town when I was a kid. A lady lost her husband and three kids. They all drowned in some kind of bad weather boating incident.
1958,1,kobe,"A mate of mine lost his parents and only brother to a drunk driver when he was 15, we were waiting after sports practice and my father had a policy of never leaving anyones child alone at school.

The police arrived after about 30 mins and told him.  He came home with us that night and moved to the north of England to an aunt the next day.

I never saw him again and it was long before the internet so I can only imagine how awful it must be to lose a couple of family, let alone all of them!"
1959,1,kobe,"So sad. A family near me had their car crashed into on Christmas by someone who went into their oncoming lane. One adult daughter and the parents died instantly, as did the other driver at fault. The other daughter was in hospital for days as they tried to save her. She finally passed, and I felt relief for her. I couldn't have survived that. Imagine waking up to the news your entire family died."
1960,1,kobe,"A local story to me is a housefire caused by Christmas tree lights...the father was badly burned trying to rescue one daughter but couldn't manage it...he was aware his wife was getting the other daughter...only he was dragged out/made it out. He has since gone on to marry again and has a daughter, after recovering from his severe burns. I'm glad he has found some happiness, because I would have just wanted to die.

Another case I followed was another Christmas one. A family had their car crashed into by someone who went into their oncoming lane. One adult daughter and the parents died instantly, as did the other driver at fault. The other daughter was in hospital for days as they tried to save her. She finally passed, and I felt relief for her. I couldn't have survived that. Imagine waking up to the news your entire family died.

And that scenario is exactly a few of the survivors of the New Zealand volcano eruption faced. One mother stayed on the boat while her whole family went and were killed. One 20 or so year old young man woke up from a coma with significant burns to be told his parents died, and so did his sister, but her body could not be located. He had to skype into the funeral.

It's so tragic."
1961,1,kobe,"Check out Stephen Colberts recent (6 months ago?) interview with Anderson Cooper. Cooper and Colbert both lost their dads when they were kids, Colbert lost his in a plane crash along with two of his brothers. The interview is incredibly moving and Colbert is really open about how it completely reoriented his life.

Edit: [here](https://youtu.be/YB46h1koicQ)"
1962,1,kobe,I really enjoyed watching that. Stephen has some really beautiful things to say around 13 minutes. I liked how because both of them are professional conversationalists they were really patient and had good timing for when to add in their piece.
1963,1,kobe,"She took over her father's family business and he had a great life insurance policy so she's good financially. It's hard to tell though, she probably has good and bad days. Losing my father and older brother, I can only relate partially, but damn some if our conversations have been some of the deepest most genuine conversations I've ever had

She posts a lot of throwback photos of her late family members on Facebook and people give her loads of support. She still celebrates their birthdays too. I think she's doing as well as anyone could in her position. Her family woupd certainly want her to find closure and move on (not that you fully can with something like this).

She's tough as nails though. I look up to her like the older sister I never had. Makes me tear up a little writing this. Love yourselves. Love others. Let others love you."
1964,1,kobe,Look after her
1965,1,kobe,"Jesus, imagine having to go through holidays and be reminded of something that tragic, every single year. I hope theyre in a good position"
1966,1,kobe,What do you even do at that point tbh. I think Id just become an alcoholic for a few uears
1967,1,kobe,I think Stephen Colbert went through something similar.
1968,1,kobe,"Father and 2 brothers, not entire family. But still."
1969,1,kobe,"A girl I was good friends with died in a heli crash last July coming back from the Bahamas along with her father, a few of her friends, and the pilot. 

Her parents were divorced so Im not sure how the mom is taking it (although I assume badly) but I saw her uncle a month or two after it happened and he was still a wreck."
1970,1,kobe,I lost an 18 year old son suddenly.  I drank pretty hard for about 7 years.  I got better.  Thank god for alcohol and trees.
1971,1,kobe,"She drinks often but really no more than the next person. I think she really took to her frienda. I've lost some family members unnaturally early myself, hence why I feel so much for her losses.

That's the only way man. Love those around you and surround yourself with those who love you. It's really hard sometimes. Meditation also seems to help."
1972,1,kobe,The local community just had a 4 person family involved in a car crash.  All but the mother died.  I can't imagine wanting to live anymore anyway...
1973,1,kobe,"This legitimately makes me want to quit my job and go do something I actually care about. 

Life is fleeting for all of us."
1974,1,kobe,I cant imagine how many people are feeling this way too. I can feel pain far across the globe
1975,1,kobe,"This basically happened in my backyard. As a pilot myself, visibility was incredibly low and it looks like they flew into a mountain under IFR.

Edit: listened to the ATC recording and after reading more about the flight, this pilot was trying to fly VFR under really low ceiling in a low mountainous region. 

The clip I listened to was a transition from Burbank class C airspace to Van Nuys class D (my home airport). Van Nuys cleared the pilot to follow the 101 freeway, which is just south of the field, towards Camarillo. 

Presumably, the pilot was too low to receive traffic alerts and instruction from the SoCal radar center and that was the last he was heard of. 

Convinced this pilot tried to squeeze between the mountain and the low cloud layer. The helicopter they were in is multi engine and has an incredibly low mechanical failure rate. 

Im not going to blame the pilot without details but most aviation accidents are due to pilot error and the way this is developing is making me think thats the case here.

Edit 2: according to reports, even LAPD helicopters were grounded due to weather this morning and they usually rotate 4 airships at all times."
1976,1,kobe,Is IFR instrumentation in helis much different then planes? I swear I've heard numerous instances of helicopters just straight up flying into shit under IFR conditions.
1977,1,kobe,Both are pretty dangerous. I just dont get why they didnt have a GPS with terrain avoidance.
1978,1,kobe,"I dont get how that wouldnt be mandatory, at least for carrying passengers."
1979,1,kobe,"Most controlled flight into terrain 'accidents' are pilot error.

Unless they find something wrong with the helicopter, this will likely be pilot error.

Can't wait for the press to figure out who the pilot was and how much experience they had with the S-76."
1980,1,kobe,"Not trying to rock the boat against a rotor head. I fly fixed wings, but my brother is a 5k+ hour helo Pilot and he didnt get his IFR till around 4,000 hours. I wouldnt say its super common for non Mil.

Meanwhile I started training for mine at 90 hours in a fixed wing."
1981,1,kobe,"r/flying has a link to the audio - it looks like it was special VFR - so a limited visual flight rules due to weather with requested flight following from ATC (meaning a controller would guide them along their route), but got too low and cut off from the controllers. Obviously hard to say exactly what happened, but its possible the pilot was just too low and hit the terrain he couldn't see due to clouds/fog."
1982,1,kobe,"My husband has his IFR rating but will still not fly in IFR conditions. Not worth it! He flies to work and for fun, and when it doubt, he drives."
1983,1,kobe,Same. Its good if you need it but Id never intentionally fly ifr.
1984,1,kobe,he commutes in a helicopter? what does he do
1985,1,kobe,Helicopter pilot.
1986,1,kobe,Yeah it's wild because the last new article I had read was Kobe congratulating Lebron for breaking his record. Now this.. Incredibly sad.
1987,1,kobe,"His poor wife, and kids, losing not only their dad/husband, but sister/daughter as well.  How do you even break that news to the other kids? My heart goes out to his family.
E: a word"
1988,1,kobe,"I hope the media is easy on the family and does not bombard them for comments or pictures. 

My mother, who lost my brother just texted me this:

I literally am crying thinking about it, as I do every single time I hear a parent has lost a child. It is the most excruciating pain! Your whole heart and soul burning in pain. And to do it so publicly. I wanted to keep our loss private as long as I could, and I couldn't, so for this mom....

It is important for everyone to remember these are people just like us. I know some people have that mindset of well they chose fame.... Never in their lives could they have imagined this would happen."
1989,1,kobe,"TMZ reporting Kobe's 13 year old daughter also killed in crash.

2000,1,kobe,Same man. They mechanically creep me out
2001,1,kobe,"My grandpa was a pilot in ww2 and he was always terrified of helicopters. His logic being a plane can still fly and be landed without power but a helicopter would just fall. 

From what Ive heard he wasnt completely right about that but I get the idea"
2002,1,kobe,"A low altitude hover is the most dangerous period for helicopter because there isn't time to attain auto-rotation before impact with the ground. 

Otherwise, yes a helicopter can essentially glide, the air rushing through the blades causes them to spin and create lift. An auto-gyro flies using this phenomenon."
2003,1,kobe,"The only helicopter flight Ive been on was relatively smooth...

Of course, it was a medevac chopper rescuing me from a plane wreck..."

Edit: her second oldest. Which tears me up just a tad more because I am close with my sister who is about the same years apart. Then we have a much younger sibling. It was just us for a while. Heart goes out to the whole family and the friends."
2006,1,kobe,Second oldest
2007,1,kobe,Oh jesus christ
2008,1,kobe,"That's a big deal. At his level, he didn't have to do any of that."
2009,1,kobe,"Most people at that level wouldn't have done any of that, if not expected their security to remove the kid."
2010,1,kobe,Most people at all wouldnt have done a thing. Shows great character regardless of his status. RIP Kobe
2011,1,kobe,"Thats a hell of a good story.

RIP"
2012,1,kobe,"&gt; I was on the verge of tears when Kobe turned to the stadium security guy and told him I was his guest. He then told his bodyguard to leave me alone and said he'd sign anything I had.

And here come the tears again"
2013,1,kobe,"These are the kinds of stories you never hear.

Everyone only hears what they want to hear, and they listen to whatever satisfies their agenda. Sometimes good, sometimes bad, but the bad is always louder than the good, and it sucks."
2014,1,kobe,What a great story. Thank you for sharing that.
2015,1,kobe,wow amazing story
2016,1,kobe,Thats really cool. Do you still have the pennant?

2024,1,kobe,All the money in the world can't buy your dad back too. So sad for his family.
2025,1,kobe,He packed so much into 41 years. LEGEND.
2026,1,kobe,It's so sad. At 41 it was like his life just begun and he could wind down and hang out with the family. Totally fucked.
2027,1,kobe,honestly he probably lived more in those few years than most of us live in 100
2028,1,kobe,I know you mean all respect but it's still saddening he wouldn't get time to unwind his life with his family
2029,1,kobe,"He had become so relaxed in his post-playing days. You could tell. The chip was off his shoulder and he was enjoying family time plus success in business. 

What a fucking shame this is."

2032,1,kobe,TMZ reports his 13 year old daughter was on board.
2033,1,kobe,Sad to say I trust TMZ's reporting more than the major networks in situations like this - I do hope they are wrong this time though.
2034,1,kobe,TMZ actually has great fact checking. Its just the type of content they fact check is often unsavory.
2035,1,kobe,"This. Their fact checking is excellent. 

I once reported that a celebrity's house burned down near me and they contacted me for all sorts of proof and documentation. It never even made it into their news reel (the celeb was basically D-list by then), but I was impressed by how thorough they were for a story that wasn't even interesting enough to publish."
2036,1,kobe,Absolutely shocked.
2037,1,kobe,"I can't believe this is true, I had to check like 4 other places to confirm. This is fucking terrible"
2038,1,kobe,"I did the same. Its so surreal like its some bad joke people are playing on the public. One of the greatest of all time in the game, at age of 41, dies in a helicopter crash. I cant believe it."
2039,1,kobe,"Stevie Ray Vaughan - one of the best (and in my opinion ""THE best"") guitarists of all time - also died in helicopter crash, aged 35."
2040,1,kobe,"The past few years have made me scared to ever ride in a helicopter. First the owner of Leicester City, and now Kobe? These things seem like bad business."

2048,1,kobe,So they said it was foggy.  Did they just fly too low and run into the mountain?  So sad.
2049,1,kobe,"TMZ confirmed it as well but looks like it crashed their site https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/

Edit: I used the amp link bc tmz was down, but as tmz is back up this is the most recent post, which also says his daughter passed as well but Ive heard conflicting reports on that. 
 
https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/"
2050,1,kobe,"During the live press conference, the sheriff said that they believe there were 9 people on board, a pilot and 8 passengers. He also called out TMZ for being wildly inappropriate and said imagine finding out a loved one has died through social media, he has requested that people stop speculating who was on board and to keep their loved ones in mind.

Edit: I watched the rest, this time the man that spoke before the sheriff came back (man with a grey streak in his hair, dark green shirt and dark skin):
they dont know anything for sure yet. They received the report 9:47 AM, arrived 8 minutes later and due to magnesium, the fire took one hour to extinguish. The coroner is on site with a team and theyre working hard to get answers.
They dont know what happened, they dont know where the helicopter took off, they dont know for sure where it was going (these three questions kept being asked). It will take some time to identify everyone and to notify the next of kin, he once again stressed for people to stop speculating and to keep loved ones on mind. The area that they are investigating is about an acre, thats also where they expect most debris to be at and where bushes were on fire.

Honestly, it was him constantly repeating that they dont know what happened yet since the press kept asking the same questions. They also kept pestering him about taking an hour to extinguish - but again, thats because of the magnesium.

After that they called for a spokesperson that can speak Spanish and I turned it off.

[Good news article here that has a better summary of the conference and updates](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-26/aircraft-slams-into-hillside-explodes-in-flames-near-calabasas)."
2051,1,kobe,"That comment bothered me the most. I really hope his family did not find out that he died because TMZ posted it. 

I am also worried that there is possibly some other family members or other people of note that died on the crash. This seems so surreal to me for some reason."
2052,1,kobe,"I found out my sister died through a Facebook post. It's really jarring and surreal, it takes your brain a moment to connect. I unfriended my sister's cousin, the one who made the post the moment she found out. It's a terrible way to get news like that"
2053,1,kobe,"My mom does an excellent job any time somebody close passes. She addresses anyone that she thinks is active enough on Facebook to refrain from posting such news until she knows everyone that needs to learn the news has been informed.

edit: My dad nowadays has been good at doing the same. He isn't present on any social media, so he had to learn what it was my mom was actually trying to accomplish each time. But he's consistent with doing the same thing now. I think his main goal is to help take that responsibility off of my mom's shoulders so that she can focus on what's important and to be able to mourn and be with anyone affected."
2054,1,kobe,"Sorry you had to find out that way. I found out my mom died from the news and Facebook. So, I know its incredibly devastating, and heartbreaking to endure."
2055,1,kobe,My grandfather died recently and he was quiet prominent in the community. It was immediately on Facebook. My cousin was on the first leg of two flights home. We had to watch for his plane to land and call him before he saw it. I hate that he had to experience that in a crowded airport.
2056,1,kobe,"Crazy, I was just reading how LeBron honored him last night with Mamba 4 Life written on his shoes. So eerie. 

https://clutchpoints.com/lakers-news-lebron-james-honors-kobe-bryant-through-his-shoes-vs-sixers"
2057,1,kobe,Kobes last social media posts were also congratulating LeBron.
2058,1,kobe,tells you the type of person he was...my heart...rest in peace
2059,1,kobe,yeah he did that because he just passed Kobe on the All-time NBA scoring list for #3
2060,1,kobe,I was actually thrown off when the report hit my phone because of this.  Media had been interviewing him a lot on his thoughts on Lebron so I thought it was more of that.  When my brain registered the full headline I was totally shook up.
2061,1,kobe,"Its so surreal scrolling through my Instagram because theres a lot of Kobe stuff because I follow a lot of NBA profiles, but they arent in chronological order so Im seeing the tragedy mixed with the passing the torch type stuff from last night. I cant believe this. Heartbreaking."
2062,1,kobe,that is unbelievable
2063,1,kobe,"[Kobe's daughter GiGi (Gianna, 13) also confirmed on board the helicopter and deceased.](https://amp.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/)"
2064,1,kobe,Beautiful picture.
2065,1,kobe,It really is. I almost didn't click. This is a picture that will / should be used over and over in honor of their memory over the years to follow.
2066,1,kobe,"Ill always remember him as an under aged teenager that came to my bar in a nightclub in LA not long after signing with the Lakers. 

I remember being nervous that he would order a drink and Id have to be in the uncomfortable position of carding him, knowing he was under 21.  

At the time we had some other out of control under aged celebs that created drama (Leo DeCaprio Im talking to you) 

When Kobe got to the bar, he ordered an Evian.


[My wife tried finding my autographed jersey but could only find this](https://imgur.com/gallery/jP5TpwM)"
2067,1,kobe,More stories pls
2068,1,kobe,My assistant had a framed picture of he and Kobe looking like best friends.  He worked as an usher at Staples.  One day he asked if he could get a pic and Kobe took it to the extreme and spent a while hanging out and mugging for pics with him.  By all accounts I know he was incredibly generous and patient for his fans.
2069,1,kobe,What about the DiCaprio story?
2070,1,kobe,He would be in the VIP lounge where there was bottle service and be standing on the tables drunk and screaming.  I hated his guts for years for being such a spoiled douche (I think Wolf of Wall Street was very much something he drew from personal experience).  Ive since softened as I wonder how fame and fortune for someone so young would effect anyone.  And his body of work is quite astounding.
2071,1,kobe,I like you as a person.
2072,1,kobe,"Had a friend meet him at some industry party, and he was SUPER rude to my friend. Because he was quite drunk. 

I'm seeing a pattern."
2073,1,kobe,Thx man.
2074,1,kobe,Of course he did. He had to be at the gym at 4am to practice shooting.
2075,1,kobe,Exactly.  My impression at the time was that he wasnt the type to pollute his system with alcohol.
2076,1,kobe,Interesting. My sister was his Spanish class partner at Lower Merion. She always said how nice he was. He signed a piece of loose leaf paper (at her request) after he declared for the draft. Watching his growth from his time at Lower Merion to today was mind blowing. Despite a lotta hate (Im looking at you r/nba) and the fact that he came back and destroyed the sixers in the finals...Ive always been a staunch supporter of him and his work ethic...simply because my sister attested to his kindness. But I like to think shes a great judge of character.  After all...she hates me.
2077,1,kobe,Not the news I was expecting this morning. RIP to one of the greatest to play.
2078,1,kobe,"I don't watch basketball and I still know him. And yelled ""Kobe"" when throwing stuff. Quite a shock."
2079,1,kobe,Lebron just beat Kobes scoring record last night. Freaky timing.
2080,1,kobe,His last post was of him and LeBron =
2081,1,kobe,"[His last tweet.](https://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/1221276426164269056)

Makes it so much more surreal that he's suddenly just gone."
2082,1,kobe,About to say the same thing. People are laughing and posting memes about being burned alive.  Fuck twitter and their disgusting users.
2083,1,kobe,I believe recently I saw some news articles that said twitter doesnt like____ and it confuses me because never have I gone to twitter for sound reviews of anything.
2084,1,kobe,God damn you're not wrong.  Does twitter moderate anything on their site?  There are so many blatant racist posts and fucked up shit on his last post that are upvoted to the top and you'd think someone would be trying to remove them.
2085,1,kobe,I was surprised by that too. Im used to that sort of thing from anonymous YouTube comments but not a fucking social media site.
2086,1,kobe,I just read that too. Super sad. RIP one of the GOAT.
2087,1,kobe,My husband actually didn't believe he died for a minute because he saw the headline and thought it was a joke about that.
2088,1,kobe,I heard it on local radio and thought it was a sick joke about the scoring record at first. Hard to believe
2089,1,kobe, First thing I thought... what are the odds?
2090,1,kobe,He broke a curse that was keeping Kobe alive
2091,1,kobe,Why are you guys making me laugh now ffs!
2092,1,kobe,Because jokes help us cope with loss.
2093,1,kobe,"I have this weird thing where when I hear about plane crashes, I imagine what the final seconds of those peoples lives are like - what theyre thinking, saying, what their faces look like. It just makes me that much more sad but it always happens."
2094,1,kobe,"I do this too and it usually gives me crazy anxiety and I feel sick to my stomach. Just goes to show myself that no matter how privileged and extravagant his life probably was, death in that manner in the last seconds/minutes doesnt care about how much money you have or how much the world adores you  we all would die the same way with the same fear running through us as he did."
2095,1,kobe,"Michael Schumacher is also a good example. 7 times F1 world champion, hit his head against a rock while skiing at 10mph and best doctors in the world still can't save him anymore after several years of trying."
2096,1,kobe,"I've been having a really anxious day ever since I found out about Kobe's and his daughter's passing too. I always get really bad anxiety when I hear news like this. My heart aches and I just wish no one had to ever go through such a horrible thing. I'm so sad this happened, I hope their souls meet and they peacefully return to the cosmos, they will forever be missed."
2097,1,kobe,Death has no patience and no pity for anything
2098,1,kobe,"I was on a commercial flight years ago that lost power and cabin pressure at 30,000 feet.  We plummeted 20,000 feet before they got power back up, and then spent another 15 minutes at 10,000 feet with the most insane turbulence Ive ever felt trying to make it to another airport for an emergency landing. During that time when everything was dark and we were just falling, I was filled with intense fear and so many other emotions. Outside of the extreme fear and anxiety I was feeling, the only other thing going through my head was how can I say goodbye to my family. I was frantically trying to turn my phone on in hopes of writing a goodbye letter in my notepad and text messages in hopes that they would at least find it in the wreckage if we crashed. Its been over ten years now since it happened and I still get extreme anxiety anytime Im flying and we start to descend in altitude.  The first few years flying after that I needed to take large amounts of Xanax to even get on a plane.  Every time I read about a crash like this it brings back so much anxiety."
2099,1,kobe,Oh man. I can relate. Had a similar bad flight 12 years ago  still have to be heavily medicated to fly and still freak the hell out at take off even though ours was mid flight and not take off. Im eerily calm when were landing though because I know its almost over.
2100,1,kobe,"Feel like Ive found my family here. Never worried about flying til on a flight where an engine caught fire and I thought I was gonna die. Didnt feel fear, only intense sadness at the thought of never seeing my loved ones again. Such a surreal feeling. Now flying terrifies me."
2101,1,kobe,"I met a man with a similar experience, he said the first thing he did when he got off the plane was fall to his knees and kiss the ground"
2102,1,kobe,"I don't think planes plummet because they lose power, they can still glide and descend slowly. It's most likely they dropped 20,000 feet for oxygen reasons."
2103,1,kobe,"Yup. Normally a lot of consideration is given to passenger comfort, but that goes out the window for cabin altitude issues. Generalizing but its always something like put the mask on, establish comms, idle, start descent at max speed, then deploy spoilers/speed brakes to allow a even steeper descent to 10,000 or alternatively a terrain limited altitude. And maybe even a 90 degree turn for traffic avoidance while this is happening. 

I dont think people realize the difference bewteen what the plane can do, and what it does to make flying comfortable for the average person. Its a pretty wide capability gap."
2104,1,kobe,Clutching his daughter and telling her it would be ok I'm sure. So awful. My heart hurts.
2105,1,kobe,This was exactly what I pictured too. Him grabbing his daughter trying to keep her calm as they fall into inevitable death. So depressing.
2106,1,kobe,"Me too. I couldnt help but picture it, especially seeing photos of the two of them together. To everyone else he was Kobe, but to her he was just Dad. The first person you want to hold tight to when something is scary or wrong. Heartbreaking."
2107,1,kobe,"If it helps,  it's likely they hit the ground without knowing,  crash was at  1700ft, doing 161knts,,   they were at 1200 ft and climbed to 2000ft because of intense fog, trying to follow the highway

I'm guessing the pilot got lost in the fog,  I don't think they suffered"
2108,1,kobe,"I sadly add the last chunk to it as well. I was in a bad car accident years ago, and the last thing I remembered was a horrible sound of impact of metal against metal and this insane amount of pain in a second before it all went black. I always think of this when I see car, airplane or any kind of crashes."
2109,1,kobe,"They were flying in thick fog at 185 mph, and then all of a sudden they slam into a mountainside and perish... just... like... that. So awfully sad. I hope their last moments were not filled with fear"
2110,1,kobe,"If it's any comfort, it was really foggy and it's highly likely this was a controlled flight into terrain.. they may not have even been aware long enough to suffer."
2111,1,kobe,"That just means you have empathy, which is good."
2112,1,kobe,Thanks for saying this. I feel like a weirdo when this stuff happens and I think like the OP commenter; never saw it as an empathy thing but it makes sense.
2113,1,kobe,"Intrusive thoughts. It's basically your imagination forcing a prediction of events for importance so that you can try to avoid similar events in the future. Sometimes they are necessary, sometimes they are super abstract.


Very vivid. Very normal. The empathy point is great. RIP Kobe. I hope you felt love in those last seconds."
2114,1,kobe,"This explanation makes so much sense. I had friends who were killed in a horrific car accident and even 3 years after it happened I still get vivid morbid thoughts of what it was like in the car, what it was like to find their bodies in the car. Thanks for the odd comfort. May peace come to those who die so young and suddenly."
2115,1,kobe,Me too.  I sometimes dwell on it way too long :/ it scares the shit out of me
2116,1,kobe,Me too... terrifying
2117,1,kobe,"i remember a dream i had when i was in a plane crash. i felt a panic i cant really put into words as it went down, but right before the moment of impact, it was this sudden calm, leaving me feeling completely sedated and at peace

but then the planes exterior broke like eggshells and i was sitting in my untouched seat like it was from gmod, so theres that too"
2118,1,kobe,"I went to high school with Kobe. He was a senior when I was a freshman. Seniors are already larger than life to freshman but can you imagine having Kobe as your idol, 360 dunking IN GAME, taking Brandy to the prom etc. When I was a senior he would always hook the team up with Adidas gear and come visit Coach Downer once in a while &amp; give us a pep talk. He made me believe that anything is possible. 

This news makes me sick to my stomach but I promise if Kobe could speak he would say don't be sad because he achieved all his dreams and then some. He would probably want us to focus on our own aspirations and pray for the families of the other four who died. He was as fierce a competitor you could find, but off the court was a gentleman, a beautiful dichotomy. RIP  I still cant believe it."
2119,1,kobe,He flew just two weeks ago to pretty much the middle of nowhere (Central Washington State - apologies to my fellow Cashmere residents) to see one of his students play in high school.  That's pretty amazing to take the time.

2122,1,kobe,"also went to LMHS, right before Kobe was there. Mrs Mastriano was my homeroom teacher; kobe often cited her as a positive force in his life. shocking news."
2123,1,kobe,"My dad was an assistant coach on Lower Merion's team while Kobe was there. My entire upbringing was built on Kobe story after Kobe story. Getting to watch him play in high school must have been out of this world.

Terrible loss for the sport of basketball."
2124,1,kobe,I went to Ridley and I remember hearing about this dude that was just insane on the court. Then there was the story about him taking Brandy to prom and I remember thinking this dude was gonna be one of the greatest NBA players ever or flame out in his rookie year. Im not a basketball fan at all so i didnt really know he made it. A few years later I heard his name again when the Sixers were playing the Lakers in the NBA Championships. I was pleased to see that he was doing well. It was nice seeing him become one if the all time greats
2125,1,kobe,"He was a household name. Whether you watched basketball or not, you knew who Kobe Bryant was. He's going to be sorely missed."
2126,1,kobe,"Yup. I know nothing about basketball, I don't know what team he played on, but even I know Kobe"
2127,1,kobe,I know Kobe from watching fps gamers yell his name while throwing grenades. Surreal shit.

2137,1,kobe,Funnily enough Kobe Bryant is a song by Lil Wayne so [KOBE BRYANT] will technically still go with the trend of naming stands after music
2138,1,kobe,"Fool FLYS outta ya body all covered in GOLD and PURPLE! Starts dribbling a materialized ball that could disintegrate a mutha fucka with a touch! 

This is my STAND! KOBE!"
2139,1,kobe,Immense power and precise movements. So it's the same type of stand as star platinum.
2140,1,kobe,Perfect accuracy move
2141,1,kobe,Sure but let's give the guy a while to get situated before we start calling in assists.
2142,1,kobe,You mean like when a Jedi dies in Star Wars and their spirit helps others?
2143,1,kobe,Kobes a force ghost? Yeah I can roll wit that. Would make sense!
2144,1,kobe,No one's ever really gone.
2145,1,kobe,Its even more important now
2146,1,kobe,Now you have to do it.
2147,1,kobe,I'm gonna fucking yell it louder now.
2148,1,kobe,It'll be better because you're honoring his memory.
2149,1,kobe,he lives on in us. as we move our crumbled paper into trashcan games forward he is there inside your heart. d

thank you to everyone who was pointing out missing ones!

EDIT2: Truely a sad day... RIP Gianna as well..."
2152,1,kobe,Not to mention he was an Academy Award winner
2153,1,kobe,"Such a great short. Its moving, beautiful, and inspiring even if you dont care about basketball or sports in general.

2159,1,kobe,"You forgot Olympic gold medallist. 
RIP Kobe!"
2160,1,kobe,"I am not an NBA-fan (really not a thing in my country) but I read so much about his work ethic, that he would train rest train rest train. There was a big essay about him a couple years ago in the German newspaper Die Zeit, about how him leaving is the end of an era and everything. Again, not an NBA-fan, still read that and was fascinated."
2161,1,kobe,"ya, he is one of the best inarguably.  Only what ranking at the top is debatable."
2162,1,kobe,His last tweet 16 hours ago congratulating LeBron on passing his scoring record. Just goes to show you never know when youre going to go. Sad and creepy.

Edit: Thank you for the Platinum.  I'm humbled by all the kindness and words of support."
2167,1,kobe,"Likewise. And by chance, the same model helicopter as with Kobe, an S76. 
For my father at least it was in pitch black and the imminent crash wasnt known. For Kobe I hope that they too did not know it was coming."
2168,1,kobe,I'm so sorry.  It's not a fun club to be a member of.
2169,1,kobe,"Dont think Ive met another member of this club before, but yes youre right. Peace and love to you and your family."
2170,1,kobe,Yours as well
2171,1,kobe,Im sorry for your loss.
2172,1,kobe,Thanks.  It was 5 years ago but it's amazing how all the memories and emotions came flooding back.
2173,1,kobe,"This type of news makes you think that no matter who you are, you never know when your time will come. Not money, fame, nor popularity will save you from such a catastrophic event. Ive had a loss recently and it made me just appreciate the moments you really have on this planet. It puts life in perspective and I hope this not just be a news article but a way for people to enjoy the moments they have with their family and loved ones. Go out and explore, do shit, make memories."
2174,1,kobe,Same here. Woke up this morning to calabassas helicopter crash sparks brush fires. Obviously I didnt realize at the time Kobe was on board...this shit really cant be happening.
2175,1,kobe,Thank god they werent in the helicopter. I cant get anything to load and was hoping his kids werent there.
2176,1,kobe,His 13 year old daughter was on board.
2177,1,kobe,"No, there were other passengers though that he had taken up with him. Couldn't yet find info on their identities. Doesn't appear to be any of his immediate family though."
2178,1,kobe,Looks like his 13 year old was on the helicopter
2179,1,kobe,"Damn, that sucks."
2180,1,kobe,"Damn man. 

RIP,  that family is forever changed."
2181,1,kobe,"I had to reread the headline, I didn't believe what I read."
2182,1,kobe,"So young.  Further proves that life can be cut short for anyone, it doesnt matter who you are or the power you have.

Give your loved ones some loving.  You dont know what tomorrow brings.

Edit: Basketball lost a great one today.  Im not a huge NBA fan, but I think everyone could recognize his greatness, fan or not.  What a sad day for his family and loved ones."
2183,1,kobe,"Success, youth, health, money, influence; all gone in an instant.

Mortality."
2184,1,kobe,2020 already off to a shit start.
2185,1,kobe,Bruh all these celebrity deaths are giving me serious 2016 deja vu...
2186,1,kobe,And another election year...
2187,1,kobe,Pls no
2188,1,kobe,"His wife and kids were not on board

Edit: according to TMZ. I live in LA but Im not a first person source of course

Edit 2: one of his daughters on board. RIP

Edit 3: 13 year old Gianna

Edit 4: they were on their way to a basketball practice. She was a star for their team. He coached.

Edit5: the other passengers were another player and parent. They were on their way to a game not a practice"
2189,1,kobe,ESPN reporter that just did the breaking news during the pro bowl said that his daughters were believed to be passengers. I haven't heard or seen it reported anywhere else though so I'm hoping he is wrong.
2190,1,kobe,"Yeah Im seeing conflicting reports. TMZ said originally that no his daughters were not on board.  His wife is confirmed to not have been, and I would assume the wife was taking care of the baby. Time will tell."
2191,1,kobe,2024 is probably gonna suck.
2192,1,kobe,"&gt;all these celebrity deaths

Wait please pardon my ignorance who else died in 2020 already??? I'm not terrible up to date on celebrity or pop culture but I knew who Kobe was - i didnt even watch basketball"
2193,1,kobe,"Neil Peart (Rush), Terry Jones (Monty Python) now Kobe Bryant.

And January isn't even over yet."
2194,1,kobe,Seems about par for every year. People are always dying.
2195,1,kobe,Fucking humans.
2196,1,kobe,"Sean Reinert, another phenomenal drummer, died yesterday"
2197,1,kobe,I think you answered your own question there
2198,1,kobe,"We got the plague, non stop fires, dust clouds of death. Wonder if the creepy clowns in random places will make a comeback too?"
2199,1,kobe,"Holy fuck, just after Lebron passed him"
2200,1,kobe,"His last tweet was congratulating his ""brother"" Lebron for moving the game forward.

There was also a viral tweet yesterday saying that as of yesterday, only 2 NBA MVPs in league history had died (NBA MVP began being distributed in 1950s)."
2201,1,kobe,Holy fuck -- that's horrible. Nobody in their right mind would have expected Bill Russell to outlive Kobe...
2202,1,kobe,"I said in another thread, but those of us that are old enough to remember how dire Magic's HIV prognosis was, my brain cannot compute that Magic has outlived Kobe."
2203,1,kobe,"Kobe died before getting inducted into the HOF. 

Fuck."
2204,1,kobe,TMZ.com is down from all of the web traffic =3
2205,1,kobe,I had to read that headline twice just to process it. I cant believe this. RIP to the greatest.
2206,1,kobe,"4:30 PM PT -- L.A. weather was extremely foggy Sunday morning, and law enforcement sources tell us even LAPD air support was grounded because of it. Flight tracker data shows Kobe's chopper appeared to first encounter weather issues as it was above the L.A. Zoo. It circled that area at least 6 times at a very low altitude -- around 875 feet -- perhaps waiting for the fog to clear.
Play video content

FLIGHT TOWER AUDIO
We know the pilot contacted the control tower at Burbank Airport around 9:30 AM PT, and the tower was aware the pilot had been circling for about 15 minutes. The pilot eventually headed north along the 118 freeway before turning to the west, and started following above the 101 freeway around Woodland Hills, CA.
At around 9:40 AM they encounter more weather -- as in seriously heavy fog -- and the chopper turned south. This was critical, because they turned toward a mountainous area. The pilot suddenly and rapidly climbed from about 1200 feet up to 2000 feet.
However, moments later -- around 9:45 AM -- they flew into a mountain at 1700 feet. Flight tracker data shows they were flying at about 185mph."
2207,1,kobe,Usually when the search party can't even be dispatched because of bad weather that's a solid indicator to terrible Aeronautical Decision Making from the pilots side.
2208,1,kobe,"Obviously the pilot couldnt navigate by instruments, so sad."
2209,1,kobe,"As a parent all I can think about is how he was probably holding his daughter so tight in the last moments, trying to protect her. So devastating"
2210,1,kobe,"I have two found memories of Kobe Bryant. 
The first was a personal encounter that occurred ages ago. I was with my uncle at South Coast Plaza in Santa Ana, CA. My uncle and I were on the 2nd floor sitting at one of the tables at Antonello Espresso Bar.  As were sitting there, we see Kobe walking towards us. He was with his two daughters.
My uncle looks at me and says Kobe speaks Italian; watch this!
In Italian, my uncle yells out to Kobe,
Kobe! Want a cup of espresso?
Kobe smiles kind of laughs and politely responds in Italian no thank you Im with my children! 
It was cool."
2211,1,kobe,"I don't know shit about basketball but he left behind a wife and 4 daughters including what sounds like essentially a newborn. That's brutal and heartbreaking and I wish the best to his family. God damn 2020 slow it down.

Edit: Sounds like early reports from ABC are saying his daughters may have been involved. That's as worst case scenario as it can get I feel like. What a fucked up day.

Edit 2: Reports are now pulling back in regards to the daughters being on board. Still nothing confirmed as far as I can see.

Edit 3: TMZ is reporting as of 2:35 pm Central time that Daughter Gianna Maria (13) was also killed on board."
2212,1,kobe,"Youngest daughter born in June of 2019, so tragic."
2213,1,kobe,"Absolutely horrendous. I cant imagine what it would be like growing up hearing about all these people talking about your dad as this legendary sportsman and how much he meant to them, and you never got to know him."
2214,1,kobe,"Fuck I didnt even think about that. Man thats so depressing, you never really get the full grasp of somebodys impact after theyve passed. Unless you were alive while it was happening, it just seems like disconnected stories."
2215,1,kobe,Don't forget the 4 others on the copter.
2216,1,kobe,"Agreed, I should have definitely included them as well. A massive tragedy for all involved. I hope for the best for all that were affected."
2217,1,kobe,Saw on TV that the other passengers could have been his daughters
2218,1,kobe,"I dont even like basketball but this is heartbreaking. Poor kids growing up dad less.

Edit: things seem to be even worse. His 13 year old daughter was on the helicopter as well? Terrible."
2219,1,kobe,It's truly heartbreaking. A 7 month old and a 3 year old being the 2 youngest will likely only remember their father through word of mouth and TV interviews/old game tapes. Can't imagine losing a parent that young. My heart breaks for the Bryant family and all the others involved.
2220,1,kobe,"Reports are saying the other passengers were his daughters. I really hope thats not true. This story is terrible

EdiT: Just [one](https://www.tmz.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-killed-dead-helicopter-crash-in-calabasas/) was confirmed. ABC I think prematurely led into the story and removed the information.

The other individuals in the crash was another parent, teammate and the pilot."
2221,1,kobe,"I cant find more confirmation than ABC that his daughters were on board but I really hope they werent. However, it would make sense. 3 daughters, but not Vanessa or the baby, + Kobe + pilot = 5

EDOT: TMZ conformed Gianna (13) has passed"
2222,1,kobe,"This is like Messi or Ronaldo dying in a helicopter crash, right?

Never really watched basketball but I have heard of him, LeBron James and Michael Jordan."
2223,1,kobe,"&gt; Never really watched basketball but I have heard of him, LeBron James and Michael Jordan.

Lebron just passed Kobe's all time points scored *last night*.  Kobe was 3rd, Lebron was 4th, and Jordan was 5th.  Just to put the three of them in perspective.  Kobe is considered one of the best to ever play the game and only retired in 2016."
2224,1,kobe,Yeah pretty much :(
2225,1,kobe,"Yeah, pretty much think of any icon in your favorite sport."
2226,1,kobe,"Yeah he was an all time great, bigger than the sport. Level Messi/Federer/Bolt"
2227,1,kobe,"Watching the news live right now, a whole bunch of people are gathering in front of Staples Center to mourn his passing and pay their respects. One of the guys interviewed was asked how long he was going to stay there, he told the reporter: ""He gave us 20 years, I'm not going anywhere""

RIP Kobe"
2228,1,kobe,"I hope kids continue to say ""Kobe"" as they throw crumbled up pieces of paper into the trashcans."
2229,1,kobe,I will never stop.
2230,1,kobe,"Every single day, around lunch time."
2231,1,kobe,Any meal time
2232,1,kobe,Any classroom
2233,1,kobe,Any office room
2234,1,kobe,I just taught my two year old daughter to do that 3 days ago... :(
2235,1,kobe,I say this literally every time I ~~yeet~~ throw a diaper into the trash with precision :(
2236,1,kobe,Yeet for distance Kobe for accuracy
2237,1,kobe,Yeet is when you just throw shit far as fuck. Kobe is when you accurately toss shit in the garbage
2238,1,kobe,"Kobe for accuracy, Yeet for distance"
2239,1,kobe,And the forbidden technique Kobyeet for when both are needed
2240,1,kobe,Is it possible to learn this power?
2241,1,kobe,"I was never a basketball fan and I still say it constantly. Definitely going to keep that tradition going.
  
On a more serious note, I hope his wife and kids get the support they need from family and friends ... it's never a good day to lose your husband or father.
  
EDIT: Hearing now that his daughter Gianna was with him. On top of the other victims as well .. just a horrible event."
2242,1,kobe,I have literally never watched a game of basketball in my life and I'll be fucked if I dont shout Kobe everytime I yeet something
2243,1,kobe,Yeet for distance kobe for accuracy
2244,1,kobe,"Or, in my case, ironic ""kobe"" for absurd lack of accuracy."
2245,1,kobe,"Hell, I say it when tossing silverware in the soak bin at work."
2246,1,kobe,I still type it when I score an arching goal in Rocket League.
2247,1,kobe,Followed by What a Save!

2249,1,kobe,"Always do. I'm 27, and I still say that shit."
2250,1,kobe,Am I crazy or are helicopters just like *not that safe?*  I mean weve had this technology for decades now and it feels like they still go down way more than planes.

""Based on hours alone, helicopters are 85 times more dangerous than driving. [Based on hours] helicopter flying is just 27 times more dangerous than driving."""
2252,1,kobe,"I was stationed in Fort Campbell during the army, and in my short time there we had two helicopter crashes that killed everyone onboard."
2253,1,kobe,"For all those speculating - the [speed and alt are already known] (https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/kobe-bryant-believed-dead-in-helicopter-crash/).

It looks like the pilot was flying to low and too fast in foggy weather conditions.  

Educated guess from the data is the pilot was not IFR and flew it into a hill and didn't realize it until the last minute (jump up in speed and alt.)"
2254,1,kobe,The fact it was so preventable makes this even worse.
2255,1,kobe,"I just don't get it...why not slow down or fly higher. It's foggy as fuck

And the rest of them on board not tell him to chill? Or I wonder if they were freaking out the whole time...

It just makes me angry"

2257,1,kobe,"Pilots do not invent new ways to crash, unfortunately."
2258,1,kobe,Did the sheriff just confirm 9 bodies... Not 5?! Omg...
2259,1,kobe,This man like just retired...what a damn shame. A true legend.
2260,1,kobe,Still surreal. Hust yesterday we were arguing his legacy on the court. Literally until late last night
2261,1,kobe,Ridiculous that forged and inaccurate video recordings of the crash are being posted on his Twitter page. People are posting a helicopter crash from Dubai in 2018 to mislead others.
2262,1,kobe,"People should understand that it was probably not possible to have a video footage.  

They crashed *because of fog*"
2263,1,kobe,He just had his latest kid born last year too. So tragic.
2264,1,kobe,"As terrible it is to hear about Kobe, it's worse to hear his oldest daughter was also with him. Kobe had already lived a great life, but she was just beginning hers. RIP to both Kobi and Gianna, and also to the other two unnamed victims of this horrific incident.


Edit: sorry, she is the second oldest."

2271,1,kobe,"Ate at la fogata this weekend, always wonder when I go if Ill see him there. Have a couple times, theyve had his photo on the wall for decades.  You were among the last to see him alive.  At least he was enjoying time with family in his final days :("

2280,1,kobe,The 1920s weren't off to a particularily good start either.
2281,1,kobe,I think it was the ending to the 1920s that was the real problem.

2286,1,kobe,There was a big helicopter crash just last month  that killed several tourists here on Kauai- it just reaffirmed my personal vow to never step foot on a helicopter. RIP Kobe.

2288,1,kobe,Blimps.  Only blimps.
2289,1,kobe,Just read that his 13 year old daughter Gianna died in the crash as well...fucking tragic
2290,1,kobe,Rest in peace to one of the greats.
2291,1,kobe,Just audibly said Holy shit in my Uber. Did not expect this... damn.

Edit: thanks for the memories Black Mamba

~~Edit: Just heard ABC report that some of his children were on board, I hope that is not true and they misspoke. :( what a 2020~~ reported untrue according to the comments. It was only 1 daughter. Gigi who was 13."
2300,1,kobe,"This is so sad, so shocking."
2301,1,kobe,I think this is the one celebrity death I cannot comprehend yet.
2302,1,kobe,Agreed. Hes only a few years removed from one of the greatest NBA careers ever. He was way too young for this.
2303,1,kobe,Unfortunately his 13yo daughter Gianna reported to have been onboard.
2304,1,kobe,TMZ is now reporting his 13 year old daughter Gianna was also on board. They were heading to basketball practice. Tragic.
2305,1,kobe,"Im not a basketball fan. I dont watch sports. I havent sat down and watched an entire Lakers game. 

But I lived my whole life hearing this guys name. Hes been in the news as I sat at the dinner table eating with my family, hes been in textbook math problems I solved in school, hes been on trading cards my classmates passed between each other in middle school. Hes been on t shirts and billboards and cereal boxes and all sorts of mundane things in the background of my life as I grew up. For years. My sister even named her son after this man. Someone like that seems... almost immortal. Like death cannot and will not dare touch them. And the knowledge that that person, who I knew of without knowing them, is now gone... it hits different. I am 23, still young, but this makes death feel a little realer than it did before."
2306,1,kobe,This might be the most surreal headline of 2020 so far¸
2307,1,kobe,Yeah its almost impossible to believe this happened. We all grew up looking at Kobe as immortal
2308,1,kobe,Oh god theyre reporting now that there were 8 passengers not 4. Thoughts to the families
2309,1,kobe,"Even if I became insanely rich, I would still fly commercial. So many people die on private planes and helicopters."
2310,1,kobe,"They're not that dangerous. Kobe flew on a helicopter almost every day for the past few years of his career because he lived more than an hour away from the Lakers practice facility in traffic

It just looks so much worse because high profile people travel on them frequently."
2311,1,kobe,We should probably fix the transportation in LA at some point
2312,1,kobe,"&gt;	They're not that dangerous.

The data says otherwise. Private aviation is 272x more likely to have death accidents than commercial aviation. So that said, the above-mentioned  statement is correct, That said though, Private aviation is safer than driving."
2313,1,kobe,Helicopters and private planes are about on par with motorcycles in terms of risk. Most people consider this to be pretty dangerous.
2314,1,kobe,I work at a large law firm and we have a team dealing with aviation litigation. They've all been put off flying in helicopters (not that they ever did before) because of the things they come across.
2315,1,kobe,"Helicopters just seem like a sketchy idea.  Really cool and useful, but maybe not great when shit goes bad."
2316,1,kobe,"As with lots of things in life. Their utility outweighs the risk though, so we use them."
2317,1,kobe,I wonder how the numbers change with amateur vs professional pilots and mechanics? I assume a mega rich helicopter commuter would have a professional pilot and maintenance crew.
2318,1,kobe,Biggest factor is one pilot vs two. Even the best person can have a bad day.
2319,1,kobe,"&gt;Helicopters and private planes are about on par with motorcycles in terms of risk. Most people consider this to be pretty dangerous.

2320,1,kobe,"Just wanted to leave here my condolences. I'm from Portugal, started following the NBA in 1990 and, because of that, became a Basketball coach, referee, club director, sponsor, mascot, and everything Basketball had to offer me. Kobe is a legend. Today, while working at Subway (yes, my connection to the USA came from sports and evolved for me having the longest opened Subway store in Portugal), someone told me ""Kobe died"". I was in shock. Tears came to my eyes when they told me Gianna was dead too. It shook me more than some family members, and it made me again open my eyes to life, family, love, and how we should just enjoy it all while it lasts. Kobe was a star. A big one. And he died, at his prime? At an age that one relaxes and just enjoys the results of working so damned hard? Doesn't make sense...and it hit me. Hard. I cried thinking about my two daughters, and how I need to enjoy their presence while we're all still here. Rest in peace Kobe, Gianna... Everyone, be peaceful, be happy. Love from Portugal."
2321,1,kobe,"In a 2018 interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Kobe Bryant said **Gianna** wanted to play in the WNBA ""for sure.""  He said that fans would say ""you and V gotta have a boy ... someone to carry on the tradition.""  And **Gianna** would interrupt and respond, ""I got this."" He called her the heir to his legacy. RIP Kobe and Gianna."
2322,1,kobe,"Im sure a lot of us brits don't know anything about basketball but im certain most of us know who Kobe is. This is like the equivalent of David Beckham dying for us brits. This is huge news that will sadden people all around the world. Im sorry for your loss, especially to all the Lakers fans. Tragic news man.


And i have never trusted helicopters. i wouldn't get in one if you paid me. The billionaire Leicester City FC chairman died not too long ago from a helicopter crash. At least with a plane you could maybe glide back to earth, but a helicopter is pretty much fucked if you have mechanical problems They've always scared the crap out of me."
2323,1,kobe,"Just to note, helicopters can also glide down (auto rotation)."
2324,1,kobe,"Please note that there are multiple sources refuting claims that Rick Fox or Kobe's daughters were on the helicopter. Best not to spread any potential rumors about that until they are confirmed.

Edit: Sources seeming to confirm Rick Fox was not on the helicopter

2325,1,kobe,Rick Fox was liking tweets an hour ago
2326,1,kobe,Wow. Rest In Peace to a legend in his sport.
2327,1,kobe,Wow. Was just looking at the smiling joyful face when LeBron broke his record. Anyone can go at anytime. Be the best you can be.
2328,1,kobe,I was really looking forward to the future and seeing how far his daughter might go in raising the profile and image of women's basketball.
2329,1,kobe,"My mother was shocked.

She's a 60 year old Chinese lady who never watched basketball. 

That's how much of a household name he is."
2330,1,kobe,I cant believe it. Rip to one of the GOATs
2331,1,kobe,I can't fucking believe it.
2332,1,kobe,"Wow that dude who said his sister died on the crash was telling the truth. They updated a new fatality count based on the manifest and the details he shared lined up and the brother in law posted on Facebook. 

What a tragedy, condolences to the families affected"
2333,1,kobe,One of the best to ever play the game.  So sad to think of his children having to grow up without him.  RIP Kobe.
2334,1,kobe,Gosh I don't even watch basketball and this hurts.
2335,1,kobe,"When I lived in L.A., whenever I was having a bad day or needed to clear my head, Id run. Id push open the shitty gate we had that didnt really do much, take a left around the school and run up side streets parallel to Vermont Avenue, which was a pretty big street. Id pass the ice cream trucks, caged roosters kept for cockfighting - smell the carne asada and weed that was coming from homes where people were playing dominoes in the garage. Id cross under the bridge, the traffic and helicopters drowning out whatever I was listening to from my headphones. Id hook a right on Washington, then left on Figueroa††until I was at the Staples Center. That was Kobes house. When he was playing it was the heartbeat of that city. Every person in those streets, on every block, loved Kobe because of who he was and what he represented - a champion who transcended race, demanded excellence, and stood taller than any movie star - he was Los Angeles. This hurts, and thats the best way to explain why it hurts to so many people from L.A. He represented the best of what everyone wanted to see in themselves - a drive, a mentality to win at any cost. This hurts."
2336,1,kobe,"How sad. I used to work with a guy who was a combat medic in Vietnam. He rode in helicopters back in the day and told me to never fly in one if I had a choice, as they are not meant to fly. Any one of a thousand things can go wrong and when they do, it'll fall out of the sky. I've heeded those words from then on."
2337,1,kobe,When Kobe was a kid he was constantly moving around the world with his dad and often didn't speak the language of the country they were in.  One of the reasons he gravitated toward basketball was that no matter where he was all he had to do was go down to a court and he could communicate through the language of basketball.  I always thought that was really beautiful.
2338,1,kobe,I shared of photo of my sister and dad. Thanks for the support everyone! https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/euiirn/my_sister_also_lost_her_life_today_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

2341,1,kobe, Fuck.  9 people on board
2342,1,kobe,"
Orange Coast College baseball coaching legend John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa were among the victims in Sunday's helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, that killed NBA legend Kobe Bryant.


[source](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28570865/orange-coast-college-baseball-coach-john-altobelli-helicopter-crash-victims) 

Those 3 names, Kobe, GiGi, Christine Mauser have been publicly identified.  So tragic."
2343,1,kobe,"Goodbye my childhood hero in a very far country.  The baskets I shout out your name, a childhood passing by imitating you.  I will miss you so much. -a big fan from an insignificant neighborhood of a distant third world country."
2344,1,kobe,"Man, do I feel for his family. When I was 17, I lost my father and two sisters in a plane accident. I wouldnt wish going through that on my worst enemy."
2345,1,kobe,"Please remember the 2 remaining Altobelli children. Their mother, father, and sister all apparently died in crash With Kobe and his daughter. ="
2346,1,kobe,"Incredibly sad for families of everyone on board. I will never set a foot into a helicopter, so many terrible accidents happen with those things."
2347,1,kobe,It seems like it has to be the leading cause of death for the super wealthy... Benefit to being a pleb is that my chances of perishing in a helicopter accident are astronomically low.
2348,1,kobe,"Yeah, you'll just die in a car wreck like the rest of us."
2349,1,kobe,Hey..... Some of us will die peacefully of heart failure sitting at our desks in our office due to our sedentary lifestyles.
2350,1,kobe,Wow with a group of friends we all thought it was a sick joke. Total shock.
2351,1,kobe,"I get that anonymity breeds boldness, but some of these comments are just awful."
2352,1,kobe,Mark Cuban just announced that the Dallas Mavericks are retiring Number 24 because of Kobes accomplishments and his work as an ambassador for the sport of basketball
2353,1,kobe,What the fuck is 2020
2354,1,kobe,"His youngest daughter will never know her dad or sister, that breaks my heart. Kobe seemed like one of the untouchable celebrities, one of the ones that you never think of them dying because it just seems impossible."
2355,1,kobe,"This just made me get my 38 year old ass out of bed to stop procrastinating with my dreams. An unfortunate reminder. We take too much for granted. Go do what you were meant to do.

Edit: having some good talks with some people but of course trolls are gonna troll too. Im turning off reply notices so I can dive into what Im working on. Seriously, think about how youre spending your time."

2357,1,kobe,"LA is in tears right now. Everyone who was born and raised in this city has been shook to the core. Every one of my friends and family cant believe this. I dont watch basketball and it has shaken me more than I can imagine. He was all over growing up, I cant believe hes gone and in such tragic way."
2358,1,kobe,This is fucking with me big time. He was my Mom's **FAVORITE** player and this is reminding me of her death (she passed in July).
2359,1,kobe,"I just checked his Instagram page and he appeared to be very close to Gigi because she played basketball at the Mamba Academy and he coached her along the way.

There are so many posts of her playing and its crazy to think that there will be no more of that. She was just 13, my God.

Also, the pictures with the rest of his daughters, particularly the 3-year-old and the 6-month-old are absolutely heartbreaking, given that they will grow up with zero memories of him.

Life changes in an instant...hug your loved ones tight"
2360,1,trebek,He took his declining health with such grace. RIP
2361,1,trebek,"He was always a class act. Earlier this year he even announced one of the draft picks for the NHL's Ottawa Senators ([link](https://www.sportsnet.ca/nhl/video/tim-stutzle-selected-third-overall-senators-2020-nhl-draft/)). 

Jeopardy was so enjoyable because of his knowledge, persona, and charisma."
2362,1,trebek,Its how Id like to go as well. No point in sitting around.
2363,1,trebek,that is a very Alex Trebek attitude
2364,1,trebek,"***BRNGK!***

*WHAT IS* that is a very Alex Trebek attitude"
2365,1,trebek," Sean Connery:
I pose a conundrum to you, a riddle if you will.

Alex Trebek:
I don't want to hear it.

Sean Connery:
What's the difference between you and a mallard with a cold. One's a sick duck... I can't remember how it ends, but your mother's a whore"
2366,1,trebek,"Oh God, you just reminded me Sean Connery died very recently too!"
2367,1,trebek,"Way more upset about Alexs death then Seans. I liked Connery but Jeopardy  made a difference in my life. I am way dyslexic and school wasnt a good place Id often feel like I wasnt keeping up,    I would watch jeopardy almost every day and could answer most of the questions this helped me realise that I wasnt dumb, just not a good fit for how school works."
2368,1,trebek,Question most of the answers...
2369,1,trebek,"My father's friend had cancer. He was told he'd likely live for six more months, at most. He lived his best six months... for just over ten weeks, then he died. No point sitting around indeed."
2370,1,trebek,Technically he may have been sitting when he was writing his book.
2371,1,trebek,"Unfortunately for those of us who cant afford the same care, sitting around is how we'll spend out last days if we die from cancer."
2372,1,trebek,"A lot of people when confronted with death want to do what they love as much as they can. Freddie Mercury even when he was in the final stages of AIDS wanted to sing, so the band would work in 1-2 hour spurts whenever he could muster the strength. I guess they figure they wont have another chance."
2373,1,trebek,"If I was confronted with death all I would want to do is sleep. Of course, thats all I want to do anyway. So maybe that is my calling."
2374,1,trebek,"I'm not trying to be a dick, but Jeopardy only taped 4 days a month. So it probably wasn't overly demanding"
2375,1,trebek,"Maybe it was different this year, but wasn't he much more involved with the show aside from just his time at the podium on camera?"
2376,1,trebek,Here's a [link](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/maximumfunorg/nobody-listens-to-paula-poundstone/e/69570042) to an interview with him. He goes into some length about his work schedule.
2377,1,trebek,"No one will be able to replace him on Jeopardy the way he was. It'll be like Drew Carey on The Price Is Right. While I think he does a really good job, it'll always feel different you know? I'm assuming Ken Jennings will be their first idea. Those two seemed to have a great connection."
2378,1,trebek,"God, I hope so.  I know he was recently brought on as a show consultant. Im just so afraid that they will bring on some celebrity host and ruin the entire show. Id rather Jeopardy be done than that happen."
2379,1,trebek,"You mean the answer isn't Gilbert Gottfried?

^(Maybe Jack Black)

edit: I forgot about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3djXcx2ewQ)"
2380,1,trebek,"Dude, if Jack Black hosted Jeopardy!, that would be a wicked awesome way to tribute Trebek."
2381,1,trebek,"i wouldn't hate Jack Black at it, but I think his talents are better spent elsewhere. I think Jeopardy is a full time job, more or less. Plus travel."
2382,1,trebek,Gilbert Gottfried on a killing spree
2383,1,trebek,Do you think they would shutter the show?
2384,1,trebek,"I dont, its too much of a money maker for them to. But if they couldnt get Ken, I feel like it would be the most respectful to. TV networks are not going to care about what is the most respectful."
2385,1,trebek,Hopefully someone is smart enough to pitch Jennings as the host as a way not to alienate viewers which will maximize viewership and ratings.
2386,1,trebek,Ken would be a very obvious and great choice.
2387,1,trebek,"As a hockey fan, i kinda teared up during that party of the draft."
2388,1,trebek,This would be the coolest way to get drafted! Even if it was to the Senators!
2389,1,trebek,"He was an amazing person through and through. He belongs up there with Mr. Rodgers and Bob Ross imo.

Alex made learning and trivia cool."
2390,1,trebek,"There should be a Mt. Rushmore for American icons rather than just Presidents.

Including your suggestions along with Legendary performers who have passed.

It would be a huge, set aside mountain face with all of the indispensable icons.  And Trebek just joined an elite group, in his passing.  Along with Bogart, Ball, Carson, Stewart....

EDIT: Mr Trebek was a proud Canadian.

I forgot and apologise.  It is a testament to his character he is probably considered an honorary native of all of the countries that he spent endless hours entertaining."
2391,1,trebek,"I think deep down, though he was a great American, Canada gets to claim him <Ë<Ê d"
2392,1,trebek,"Due to his pervasiveness in American culture, I totally forgot.

You are 100% right."
2393,1,trebek,"He was a treasure all round. Great Canadian, and great American."
2394,1,trebek,He was a treasure all round. A great human being.
2395,1,trebek,How about great North Americans?
2396,1,trebek,Hell yeah <Ë<Ê<˙<Ú
2397,1,trebek,Dont forget our <Ú<˝ Mexico buddies!
2398,1,trebek,"Together we bring the northern ice, the American style, and the Latin heat <Ë<Ê<˙<¯<Ú<˝"
2399,1,trebek,"Theres a name for this, right?

The North American Union - NAU

A truly unstoppable super-nation of culture, economy, history and technology.

Technically the European Union would have dibs on this first, but theyve been a shit show as a collective just as much as America has been by itself."
2400,1,trebek,"I was thinking a North American Union, leading to eventual integration of central and South American states into a Greater American Federation. Then, following many years of democracies prospering, eventually integrating Europe into a Grand Federation. With that power block, we could dismantle autocratic regimes and eventually form an United Federation of Earth."
2401,1,trebek,That depends on the potential idea of a Central America lol. But what the hell they're welcome lol <Ú<˝
2402,1,trebek,"What we can hopefully agree on is: fuck Greenland, it doesnt even actually exist."
2403,1,trebek,He is Canadian but we could do it on the Rocky Mountains and share the love.
2404,1,trebek,"&gt;He is Canadian but we could do it on the Rocky Mountains and share the love.

I'm going to take this out of context, because it sounds sexy."
2405,1,trebek,The Alex Trebek Memorial Orgy on the Rockies
2406,1,trebek,"Suck it, Trebek?"
2407,1,trebek,"Sounds good to me. Half the great people in the US arent ours anyhow. 

Lookin at you, Reynolds."
2408,1,trebek,"I totally forgot, my apologies."
2409,1,trebek,No need to apologise for an honest mistake my friend! He had just as much influence with my friends in the USA as he did in Canada I am sure.
2410,1,trebek,"Yes, the passing of those who meant something don't really deserve or need to be categorized.

He was a good guy. RIP"
2411,1,trebek,"He held dual Canadian &amp; American citizenship, he gets to be on your imagined mountain."
2412,1,trebek,"Well, Trebek was Canadian..."
2413,1,trebek,He'd also been an American citizen since 1998.
2414,1,trebek,"Yep, my fault I apologise."
2415,1,trebek,"Dont apologize, the fact that he was a great Canadian, but still considered and American icon as well shows what a stand up guy he was."
2416,1,trebek,"He has been an American citizen since 1998! Dual citizenship, I suspect"
2417,1,trebek,"An incredible man and a Canadian icon. Couldnt believe he had the strength to film the show while battling such a horrible disease.

RIP Alex Trebek"
2418,1,trebek,Especially hearing his last film date was Oct 29th.. Just a week and a half ago.  What a courageous man
2419,1,trebek,You are telling the truth. Knew a guy half his age die from pancreatic cancer. Horrible way to go. The chemo eventually makes the strongest give up the fight.
2420,1,trebek,Yes.  And brought more awareness to pancreatic cancer as well.  He will be greatly missed.
2421,1,trebek,Who is Alex Trebek?
2422,1,trebek,Pancreatic cancer is no joke. When its found its often metastatic because it doesnt show any symptoms until its too late.
2423,1,trebek,"Lost my father to pancreatic cancer almost 3 years ago. 

* In October he came back home from a 4-week cross-country motorcycle ride. 

* Diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer the day after Thanksgiving.

* Was gone in January."
2424,1,trebek,"That's so terrible. I'm so sorry for your loss. At least he had that experience of his cross-country motorcycle trip before he died. Hopefully the fact that he was able to have such a wonderful ""last"" memory is comforting to you."
2425,1,trebek,"Extremely, actually, and thank you. He felt great and the weather was perfect. 

He'd tried it two summers earlier, actually, and it was all rainstorms. Made it to Kansas before he sprained his ankle and my mother drove out there with a pickup truck to get him and the bike.

He kept saying that his perfect trip was God letting him say goodbye to the rest of the world."
2426,1,trebek,"That is great. It's almost better for it to be fast, given what I've heard about cancer. It must have been very difficult though."
2427,1,trebek,"Thanks for sharing, so glad he got to do the trip. I drove across the country and back in a car with friends years ago and it was an amazing time.

I don't have a motorcycle but hear that the riding experience is incredibly cool, taking my car trip and amping it up by being on a bike must make it ridiculously awesome.

Sorry for your loss."
2428,1,trebek,Sorry man
2429,1,trebek,2013 for my dad.  Six weeks.  Diagnosed mid-October and died the day after Thanksgiving.  The really sad thing is that after he was diagnosed they wanted to pretty much stick him in the basement of the hospital to just wait and die.  My mom had to fight so hard to get him to Wake Forest Baptist Health in hospice so he could live out the rest of his life in dignity and comfort.  She was lucky that a health insurance advocate found her and helped her.  My mom said that woman is a God send because without her he would have died in that windowless pit of a shithole Carolina Pines.
2430,1,trebek,"It was about 9 years ago for my grandpa, and a similar situation. He found out at the beginning of the year that he had stage 4 and was told he had a year left, but he only made it to March"
2431,1,trebek,"My mom was extremely lucky to survive after the tumor grew next to her gallbladder and not on the other side. Jaundice and pain immediately tipped her off.

Sad but still grateful to this day.

Edit: thank you all for the kindness, I love you reddit"
2432,1,trebek,"Likewise. My father caught it due to what we thought was gallstones.

But even survival is a tremendous ordeal. Getting rid of Pancreatic cancer involves something called the Whipple Procedure, which removes part of your stomach, part of your small intestine, the gall bladder *and* the cancerous part of the pancreas. Then the surgeon has to sew the remaining parts back together in a way that allows you to still eat food.

My dad had his surgery 4 years ago and is still cancer free, but he still isnt healed, and we dont expect he ever will be. But hes grateful for every day he gets.

EDIT: lots of whipple survivors in this thread! Thats so awesome to see- sadly, most people my dad has met through support networks arent still with us today."
2433,1,trebek,"The whipple is quite literally a miracle of modern medicine, but like you said. Its no fucking joke. Hopefully your dad will get close to 100% but it can take like a decade"
2434,1,trebek,Work friend had Whipple exactly a year ago.  Shes doing great!
2435,1,trebek,"I just tried to schedule my pops for the whipple after radiation in Pittsburgh. Radiation didnt help and tumor is to close to huge vein/artery also its causing liters of fluid to be drained weekly right now. My brain is befuddled rn, I know his time is coming soon but I cant believe how fast its taking him. Feels like yesterday we figured out he had it."
2436,1,trebek,"Same, just be there for your family. It ain't easy."
2437,1,trebek,"I took pictures of my pops from start to finish. He doesnt know; Ive never showed him the pics to keep him from getting more down. But the deterioration of his physical features and his weight loss gets me looking through the pics. Im with him everyday now since I got laid off, and Ill go into debt and file bankruptcy before I go back to work at this point. Idk how much longer my old mans has, I hope I have him for one more Christmas season. 
Best wishes to you and your family internet friend!"
2438,1,trebek,Ironically the whipple is old surgically. They figured it out then and havent been able to improve on it
2439,1,trebek,My wife's dad just passed from pancreatic cancer. When he got diagnosed  I ended up doing a bunch of research on the Whipple procedure. From what I gather it's one of the most complex surgeries a doctor can perform
2440,1,trebek,My best to your dad.  He is a courageous man.
2441,1,trebek,"I'm grateful your father made it! 

I also experienced something similar as I found out I had kidney cancer through a kidney stone. I went in to get a CT scan to see how big the stone was, and they instead told me I had a large tumor on my kidney."
2442,1,trebek,Father had whipper done back in 2014. Still with us today. The recovery was awful Ive never seen a man so down and out. But thank god he is with us now. F*** cancer.
2443,1,trebek,Great for your dad. My mom did not survive the surgery. Fuck pancreatic cancer.
2444,1,trebek,Thanks for sharing that story about your mom.  Its nice to hear about some people that survived this awful disease.  Im glad shes still around for you.
2445,1,trebek,"Cancer is no fucking joke. As someone who's watched loved ones go through it, it fucking sucks. I'm so happy for you and your mom, u/schoolairplane"
2446,1,trebek,"Going through it right now, it fucking sucks indeed"
2447,1,trebek,Hey man I hope you get better. My sister is in treatment right now and shes getting better. You can do this
2448,1,trebek,"My comment was so poorly phrased. It's my father, but thank you very much nonetheless!"
2449,1,trebek,sending you and ur father good vibes =§ you guys *will* get thru this! good luck!
2450,1,trebek,"Best of luck, friend. d"
2451,1,trebek,Good luck friend.
2452,1,trebek,Cherish your parents for as long as you can
2453,1,trebek,"Same story with my grandfather, who had the Whipple procedure back in 2015. He turned 90 last month."
2454,1,trebek,Thats amazing. Best wishes for your whole family.
2455,1,trebek,I was telling my friends and family that it seemed like my mom was the only one I had ever heard of making it through pancreatic cancer. The exact same thing happened with my mom. Her eyes turned yellow so she thought she had Jaundice so went to urgent care and they sent her to the ER immediately and they caught it. Shortly there after she had a Whipple Procedure at UCLA. The cancer never came back and she lived for another 20 years before dying this year. Were very lucky to have gotten the extra time with our moms. Such a terrible disease.
2456,1,trebek,"This is so inspiring! My mom is a 4 year survivor and her doctor said she wouldn't make it more than 6 months, so we got a new doctor. Now she has no signs of cancer but she does have side effects from her Whipple but we'll take that over cancer any day. 

 Happy endings are hard to come by but your mom gives me so much hope."
2457,1,trebek,"Question, is her life normal? Is she in pain? Can she eat normally?"
2458,1,trebek,"It's not ""normal"" but it's getting back to as normal as possible. I'm not going to lie, it was not an easy road. 

Her second doctor had the mentality that she would be on chemo for the rest of her life (me and him had different expectations of how long that would be) and over did it. Now she has neuropathy in her hands and feet and that limits her but she's adjusting. 

As far as the Whipple, she went in for surgery twice. The very first doctor she had went in for surgery, saw the tumor was around an artery and gave up. Told us just to make her comfortable. Second (with a third doctor) was a success but she had issues with nutrition. She spent more time in the hospital from malnutrition than from the cancer. But once that was finally under control, she's finally able to eat normal. If anything, she eat more than she use to. She lost a lot of weight and now eats ALL THE TIME. There should probably not eat but still does. She's doesn't feel like anything is off limits to her. It might be TMI but the one issue that hasn't been solved is how often she goes to the bathroom after eating (this is why she can't gain weight) but he doctor is still working with her and making some progress. 


Looking back, I typed a lot. TL;DR: she lives a somewhat normal life now and eat whatever she wants."
2459,1,trebek,"Same happened to my grandma, but ultimately it came back and was inoperable. But she did live like 3 years longer than the doctors expected"
2460,1,trebek,"This exact same situation happened to my mom last fall. After 6 months of chemo and a tumor removal operation,  she is cancer free. Glad your mom was fortunate as well!!"
2461,1,trebek,"My dad is another survivor thanks to luck and incredible doctors. He had no symptoms, it was picked up during checks because of random GI issues he was complaining of (a bit of a hypochondriac in that regard); hes very lucky but I think mentally he still worries how long he has left. Were just grateful. He still has issues due to the whipple but hes alive!"
2462,1,trebek,"My mum has just started her battle against pancreatic cancer now, they cut out half her pancreas and her spleen but sadly found it had got to two or three lymph nodes.

Once she recovers from surgery shell be going into chemo.

Im glad to hear your mum survived, if it gives me some hope we have a chance!

Much love to your family."
2463,1,trebek,Wishing lots of love and strength to your Mom.
2464,1,trebek,My dad went to a doctor because of jaundice(super yellow eyes) early in the year and died next september because the doctors didn't catch it...
2465,1,trebek,"Yep, Whipple procedure like a month or so after diagnosis. It worked thank god, she wishes she could drink alcohol like before but tastes change lol."
2466,1,trebek,"Exact same boat. About two years ago my father felt sick and was a bit jaundice. The tumor was pinching it causing the pain and because of the location, it was caught really early. 

We saw two local doctors who told my dad to get his things in order, then went to Mayo in Minnesota and found a very optimistic doctor who treated my dad with chemo/radiation and now my fathers in remission and hes golfed more this summer than he had in his entire life. 

I know exactly how you feel and Im so happy to hear another story of someone kicking PCs ass"
2467,1,trebek,Same situation with my dad. Jaundice allowed us to catch it at stage-1b and get a Whipple. He just exceeded his 2 year life expectancy after surgery and this are still going alright.
2468,1,trebek,Same thing happened to my friend; he was unlucky to get pancreatic cancer but lucky enough that it grew in a spot to cause a gallbladder blockage as to give symptoms that resulted in finding the cancer early.
2469,1,trebek,"My dad was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer just last week. We are awaiting his PET scan. Jaundice was the first sign for him to. So glad to hear your mom came through, it gives me hope!"
2470,1,trebek,"Every quick loss in my family to cancer has been to pancreatic cancer. Its the one I worry about the most. My aunt survived it by being vigilant and insisting on tests when she felt like something was wrong. 

I really appreciate how he tried to share his journey with us all."
2471,1,trebek,What symptoms tipper her off?
2472,1,trebek,"Upper GI pain that wouldnt go away with traditional GERD treatment. They treated her for it for a couple of months, but she didnt have the after eating kind of pain, it was pretty constant. She is a very diligent person and figured out pretty quickly that it wasnt heartburn, and the doctors respected her and listened."
2473,1,trebek,how do they test for it?
2474,1,trebek,"An ultrasonography usually reveals the cancer if there is any.

Edit: I said ""usually"" on purpose, sometimes pancreas is obscured by abdominal gases. An MRI or CT is the definitive diagnostic method for pancreatic tumors."
2475,1,trebek,"Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography, sometimes shows on MRI or CT but ERCP is definitive"
2476,1,trebek,Pretty much the worst cancer to get.
2477,1,trebek,*Glioblastoma has entered the chat...*
2478,1,trebek,Fuuuuck glio so much. Took my dad when I was 7. I'm now his age when he passed (34) and am somewhat concerned if I'm at risk.
2479,1,trebek,"My mom passed from a GBM as well. When I got a new doc a few years later, the first thing he said to me is that there are no known hereditary links and that theyre basically random."
2480,1,trebek,"They say that, but my moms father passed from GBM at 40, and now shes in her 40s battling it. While it could be a coincidence, theres a lot they dont know about it."
2481,1,trebek,"Damn. Im really sorry to hear that. 

Yeah I agree theres a lot they dont know. I believe that GBMs can be a fairly diverse group of different cancers, which is part of what makes them difficult to treat."
2482,1,trebek,"My moms pancreatic cancer is from a known genetic mutation in the ATM gene. My sister had genetic testing done and has the same mutation, which puts you at a higher risk for pancreatic cancer.  

My mom had breast cancer and when she was first diagnosed her oncologist encourage genetic testing. She did it and found out it was due to a mutation that could be passed on and that same mutation increased the risk of pancreatic cancer. Because of that, 10 years later when she wasnt feeling well and they knew of her risk, they looked for pancreatic cancer and caught it extremely early giving her a lot better chance of survival.

All of that to say, its not always random."
2483,1,trebek,"Fuck glio. Took my mom. I was fortunate enough to have her for 32 years though.

Fuck it again for taking a good friend at 19 in 1998.

And fuck it again for a college friend who just had his first child taken 4 years ago.

And fuck it again for taking a long time family friend 2 years ago.

Yeah, fuck glio."
2484,1,trebek,"For a rare cancer, that's a remarkable amount of people you know who've had it."
2485,1,trebek,"I worked in cancer clinical trials for a few years. glio is a complete asshole. and yea, pancreatic cancer spreads before you even know you have it. Cancer is evil. Younger people are lucky to have new treatment options. Typically it takes about 10 years to develop and test a new drug to treat cancers. And about $2 billion dollars invested by whichever company, usually pharma or gov't sponsored, to complete the research. A pharma company can invest about $2 billion into creating a new drug or treatment option that is better than the current standard of care, only for it not to work correctly and hurt people, therefore ending the trial with all money lost and more importantly, lives lost. It'll be so cool to see a lot of the drugs on trial start to be used this decade. The future is extremely bright in regards to new treatments for younger and future generations. It just sucks we're still losing so many awesome people. Gotta focus on the future and knowing we may be the last generation to really have to deal with this bullshit. Also, anyone on a clinical trial is a true hero along with research nurses. Seriously heroes."
2486,1,trebek,I wonder if they live in an environment with increased risk factor of some sort... maybe an opportunity for a lawsuit somewhere
2487,1,trebek,Spread through Chicago suburbs and WI. The only thing geographically in common would be Lake Michigan drinking water.
2488,1,trebek,Thanks for responding. Probably just an awful coincidence? I do wonder. Im no epidemiologist and those guys are all busy atm.
2489,1,trebek,"Fuck man, that's some cursed shit.  I am sorry for your losses"
2490,1,trebek,Never too early to get a check up
2491,1,trebek,How does one get a check up for cancers?
2492,1,trebek,"Yeah, beyond prostate cancer finger up bum, and fondling my balls (my doc does both simultaneously, to save time), I don't know how I'm supposed to get a checkup that'd find any other cancer."
2493,1,trebek,"Blood cancers can show up on routine blood work. You can also get tested for prostate cancer with a PSA test. There are some lab tests available for certain types of cancer (CA-125) and there is genetic testing available for hereditary types of cancer (particularly breast, ovarian, and colon cancer). 

Other than that, it can be hard to find cancer. Keep track of any moles and changes in your skin. And if you have any unexplained symptoms, get it checked and push for more testing if you have to."
2494,1,trebek,"Great info. Also, for breast cancer, if a female gets a mammogram when recommended, ""precancer"" can be found and treated with near 100% survivability. Mammograms hurt, I hear, but def hurts less than cancer."
2495,1,trebek,"Yes, mammograms are so important! So are Pap smears. Theyre uncomfortable, but changes in cervical cells can be treated before they truly become cancer."
2496,1,trebek,"Yes!! Women, particularly younger women or teens, please please please don't brush severe pelvic/menstrual pain, heavy bleeding, or other gyno issues aside as just ""part of having a uterus/ovaries"" like I did for too long. After just enduring debilitating, stabbing pain, I mentioned it in passing at my regular pap smear exam. Got an immediate ultrasound and had multiple large ovarian cysts. Turns out I have PCOS, an endocrine disorder that attacks many things,  including an increased chance of endometrial cancer. 

15 years later, I go to a different gyno for a check-up and to see if I was indeed infertile (which is what I'd been told for years). Another ultrasound showed a thickened uterine lining. One biopsy later, I found out I had very early endometrial cancer with multiple polyps. Had to get a D&amp;C and I am infertile and still at risk for cancer. 

It sucks, but if I had kept ignoring the pain that I thought all females experienced during ""that time of the month"", I wouldn't have discovered my PCOS and known that I needed regular exams due to being high risk. 

Ladies, please tell your gynecologist about any pain or abnormalities!!"
2497,1,trebek,"Friend found his when he had an MRI for a hip problem. After the MRI he asked the tech ""So hows the hip?"" The tech said ""Forget about your hip. You have a tumor the size of a softball and need to get to an oncologist ASAP"" Saved his life."
2498,1,trebek,That's a unique bedside manner!
2499,1,trebek,"Get a yearly pap smear to check for cervical cancer! I got one every year since I turned 21 and they found carcinoma-in-situ two years ago when I was 29. I had surgery to remove it and all has been well (fingers crossed!!!) since then. I hate pap smears and am required to get them every six months now, but is SO much better than the alternative. If you are reading this comment and realize you are overdo for your yearly exam, book it now!!!! It can save your life."
2500,1,trebek,*cries in insurance bills*
2501,1,trebek,"My poor Dad. Symptom free, totally normal.... then one day he lost his balance for no reason.  

I assumed it was a mini stroke and dragged him protesting to a CT brain. Wasn't overly concerned. Thought he might have to go on blood thinners, lol. 

He was dead 5 weeks later."
2502,1,trebek,"Similar to my mother. The only symptom she had was sometimes one or both of her legs would go numb, to the point she would have to sit down and could not walk until she got the feeling back. She died 11mon later the day before Thanksgiving. The fucking worst Thanksgiving ever, sitting at the dinner table w no words just your dad, brother and yourself choke sobbing."
2503,1,trebek,"Fuck glio, took both of my wife's parents. Such a shitty disease with no positive outlook."
2504,1,trebek,They BOTH had a GBM? Thats some ridiculously terrible luck.
2505,1,trebek,"Yeah, it was heartbreaking. Made us question whether there was something environmental that caused it. My wife is adopted so genetics won't affect her at least if that had anything to do with it"
2506,1,trebek,I hate this cancer so much. Took my aunt at 49. She did all the aggressive treatments available basically ruining her quality of life at the end because she wanted to fight for time with her 9 year old son. It gave her one horrible year.
2507,1,trebek,Fuck glio big time. Took my sister almost 9 years ago. She was 23 years old. Fuck. Glio.
2508,1,trebek,"My MIL lost her fight with Glio, 6 months from diagnosis to death."
2509,1,trebek,My dad lasted almost a year and recently passed from it...its a terrible disease for sure.
2510,1,trebek,"Yeah, man, I lost my FIL to that a few years ago. What a terrible, awful, no good disease that is."
2511,1,trebek,"""Sup.""

*-Sarcoma*"
2512,1,trebek,My high school teacher was diagnosed and passed within the year. My uncle passed within 15 months from it. Fuck cancer.
2513,1,trebek,"I had a very dear friend get it.  Youre absolutely right. Grueling, painful, depressing when you cant eat anymore.  The worst"
2514,1,trebek,"Yeah. They caught my grandmothers pancreatic cancer at stage one only because she was having scans for something else. She was diabetic and wasnt eating so we brought her to the hospital, and while she was diagnosed with the flu, the scans revealed the cancer. The doctor said she was his first stage 1 pancreatic diagnosis, and my family has never been more grateful for the flu."
2515,1,trebek,It's also the way it spreads.  Very rapidly and very aggressively.
2516,1,trebek,"Yea, pancreatic cancer is probably considered among the most lethal of all cancers. The 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer if its discovered while already metastasized is 3%, and the thing about it is that once you get any symptoms as a result of pancreatic cancer, it probably is already at a late stage. Cancer really is terrible :("
2517,1,trebek,"My dad found out he had it in March 2019, around the same time as Trebek. 3 weeks later, he was gone. He didn't even have time to start any treatment."
2518,1,trebek,My grandmother passed away from this. Seriously it was 4 months from the day she was diagnosed until the day she left. So sad.
2519,1,trebek,My grandfather died in two weeks after diagnosis.
2520,1,trebek,"&gt; When its found its often metastatic because it doesnt show any symptoms until its too late.

Was almost the case for me with the kidney cancer I was diagnosed with recently.  Had a CT scan for a completely unrelated problem and they saw a 9cm tumor in one of my kidneys, which I have had no symptoms at all for it yet.  They thought it might have metastasized given some sclerosis on my ribs also showing up on the CT, but then I had a bone scan that came up completely clear.  So here's to hoping it has in fact not spread anywhere else when I have it removed in a couple weeks.

---
On topic: RIP to a legend."
2521,1,trebek,Indeed. My grandfather was diagnosed with Stage 4 and was in the ground 4 months later.
2522,1,trebek,"Absolutely. My aunt was only in her early 40's and ran miles every day for over ten years. Often did 5k runs or whatever it was for different causes. Calves bigger than my head. Two daughters and a husband.

She was gone within a year of diagnosis. Couldn't fucking believe it. Still can't."
2523,1,trebek,Husband died of it. Diagnosed and died within 3 months. Its the absolute worst.
2524,1,trebek,"The worst part is that for many people the end of their lives is miserable due to chemotherapy. Constant unpleasantness, vomiting, misery."
2525,1,trebek,"It's also very deep in your abdomen, so very difficult to operate on."
2526,1,trebek,"He lasted a pretty long time with it. The news is bad, but its not surprising given the nature of his illness"
2527,1,trebek,"One of my favorite professors (who co-advised my honors thesis and was an all-around delightful guy) sadly passed away from it, about a week after being diagnosed. Pancreatic cancer is insane."
2528,1,trebek,"I highly recommend reading Trebek's memoir, which he wrote in quarantine and released this July


He was so happy to have his two adult children at home with him throughout quarantine to spend the rest of his days with. He was also sure to say that while he'll be missed, no one could say he was ""gone too soon"". He was grateful for his long life, beautiful family and extremely successful career. He was ready to go and only clung on towards the end out of duty towards his wife



Edit: actual quote from his book *The Answer is...: Reflections on my Life* below 


Yep, Ill be perfectly content if thats how my story ends: sitting on the swing with the woman I love, my soul mate, and our two wonderful children nearby. Ill sit there for a while and then maybe the four of us will go for a walk, each day trying to walk a little farther than the last. Well take things one step at a time, one day at a time. In fact, I think Ill go sit in the swing for a bit right now. The weather is beautifulthe sun is shining into a mild, mild looking sky, and theres not a cloud in sight."
2529,1,trebek,That's a great suggestion thank you.
2530,1,trebek,"I've been terminally online almost my whole life. Chat rooms before I was 10, music, and sport message boards in my teens. I migrated to Reddit when Digg redesigned a million years ago. I saw the Arab Spring and Boston Marathon Bombing online, seeing the tweets appear rapidly onto my screen in real-time due to a penchant for following Boston sportswriters/coverage. I have never shied away from appreciating the good and bad that the internet had to offer, and have always been fascinated with its capacity for information, and connection.

I'm in my mid 30's now, and the past year has been the hardest in my life. Where I used to enjoy being in the thick of everything, now it's just been so so exhausting. A couple of weeks back, in the middle of crafting a response to something I was VERY upset about, 10 minutes into furiously typing, I stopped. I just deleted the few paragraphs I'd been revising/editing, closed my laptop, and walked over to the window that looked out my front yard. It was early in the morning like 7 am I think, and I could see squirrels and birds and it was very very nice. I really recommend doing this as much as you want to, but for like 90 seconds minimum each time. There is a peacefulness to it that I didn't realize I needed.

2531,1,trebek,"Beautifully said, thank you."
2532,1,trebek,"I read something this week that was just as impactful to me. Something about how when you wake up unusually early you get to see the sunrise and see the animals and the world start to wake up and how you get to experience something not many people get to see or feel. And that this is somewhat of a secret emotion. Its honestly why I woke up early today. Just laid in bed with my S/O sleeping holding her and see the sun start to creep through the window and hear the birds start to wake up. Im not a religious man, but thats the closest Ive come to a religious experience for sure."
2533,1,trebek,"I dont mean to be disrespectful, but could you clarify terminally online?"
2534,1,trebek,"Im not that person, but I think they mean that they were someone who spent the absolute vast majority of their time online."
2535,1,trebek,AhaI was concerned they meant terminal.
2536,1,trebek,"It doesn't have a precise definition, but it generally means people who spend the majority of their life online. Often someone who is terminally online doesn't have many ""real life"" friends and gets almost all of their socialization through forums, discord, video games, etc. It also generally goes hand in hand with addiction to social media."
2537,1,trebek,"I think they mean that theyve basically been living out most of their existence in the online space. Spending all free time in online forums (there are many MANY niche forums out there that arent Reddit), engulfed in social media, potentially with online communities in gaming. 
Definitely in the context of this article terminally could be confusing since it can also mean lead to/ending in death."

2543,1,trebek,"I mean, pancreatic cancer sounds pretty miserable. I'd rather die in my sleep or something, but aside from that I see your point"
2544,1,trebek,"Thats fair. But I guess I meant considering the circumstances, this is the best case scenario for a person leaving this world. Many or most people dont have the luxury of going through the process of dying quickly or painlessly. Being able to reflect on a long and satisfying life and career that allowed you change many peoples lives for the better, surrounded by those you love the most, is as good as it gets in my eyes."

2553,1,trebek,Losing Connery and Trebek so close to each other feels so heart breaking.. both have contributed so much to the entertainment industry in their own way.. 2020 continues to disappoint
2554,1,trebek,Sean Connery and Burt Reynold are sure to give Trebek some grief in heaven
2555,1,trebek,SNL has got to do something about this. The premise of the sketch could be that due to Covid there's a huge line to pass the pearly gates. Trebek ends up in line right behind Sean Connery. Maybe there's a special separate waiting area for celebrities or something. Antics ensue.
2556,1,trebek,Celebrity Jeopardy in heaven. The jokes practically write themselves.
2557,1,trebek,Your mothersh here too Trebek
2558,1,trebek,Actually shes still alive. Very sad for her.
2559,1,trebek,"Im shoorry she had to put up with you for 8 decades, Trebek!"
2560,1,trebek,He died at 80 and his mom is alive??
2561,1,trebek,"Yes indeed. Lucille Trebek is 99, born in 1921."
2562,1,trebek,You could cast Betty White and other celebrities that people assume are already dead.
2563,1,trebek,"""I came firsht Trebek.  Jusht like with your mother."""
2564,1,trebek,"My god that's perfect. The opening moments are of Farrell/Trebek looking peaceful and happy as he climbs steps surrounded by clouds. The person in line up ahead looks familiar. Oh no, please, just no. Dread takes hold. The man turns, laughs bombastically.. then your line. Perfection."
2565,1,trebek,"My take: Heavenly Jeopardy! Trebek finally makes it past the pearly gates, only for God to make him just continue hosting Jeopardy up there. Connery's been waiting for him."
2566,1,trebek,"Trebek makes it to the gates and Saint Peter judges him and asks are you worthy of entering. Trebek says ""Yes"" and Saint Peter then says you did not answer in the form of a question so Trebek is denied."
2567,1,trebek,"Worthy of entering Heaven.

What is Yes?

That doesn't really make any sense haha"
2568,1,trebek,"Yeah, Petes pulling some fuckery. The reason Jeopardy works is because the questions are worded in the form of an answer."
2569,1,trebek,Plus Im sure Trebeks mother is already in heaven. We all know what Connerys been doing to HER.
2570,1,trebek,"If someone doesn't take this and run with it, they're a damn fool! Lol."
2571,1,trebek,Awesome premise.. got a chuckle imagining that. Would definitely watch that sketch
2572,1,trebek,Jeopardy in heaven could be good.
2573,1,trebek,Saint Peter Davidson: all answers must be in the form of a question
2574,1,trebek,Depends on if you think someone who stated multiple times that he it's acceptable to be a wife beater would get into heaven. Connery was a talented actor but he was also an abusive prick.
2575,1,trebek,"If both Daryl Hammond and Will Ferrell aren't on SNL next week now I'ma be fucking upset.

Put Norm MacDonald on too, while we're at it."
2576,1,trebek,Oh shit that's great
2577,1,trebek,You mean Sean Connery and Turd Ferguson
2578,1,trebek,It's a funny name

2586,1,trebek,Van Halen dying made me feel very old recently
2587,1,trebek,i literally came to this thread with the same thought. hopefully they're up there listening to famous anal bum covers togther.
2588,1,trebek,I really hope to be able to have this resolve when/if I'm nearing the end like he had. I just can't imagine ever being able to do it. Class act.
2589,1,trebek,"I remember reading or hearing about how our hormones change as we get older. It's almost like our body is making death easier to accept. It fascinated me and I like to think if I make it to 80 or so, death will have a completely different feel than it does now."
2590,1,trebek,"My grandpa keeps telling us ""I'm leaving you all to join Grandma in about 6 months."" He's been saying this for 5 years."
2591,1,trebek,"My grandma has been preparing for when she ""kicks the bucket"" (her words, not mine) for the part 10 years. Never mind that her mother lived to be 101 lol"
2592,1,trebek,"Lol true. My great grandma used to reply to ""How are you?"" with ""Lord, just laying here dying"" for a solid 20 years."
2593,1,trebek,"Im 70 now, and my thoughts about life and death have already evolved a great deal. The human body is a magnificent organism, but it does age and degenerate with time. Once a person allows herself to emotionally acknowledge this, the realization begins to hit home."
2594,1,trebek,Wait a few years and you'll be old enough to run for president! Stay in shape.
2595,1,trebek,"I think it's also a matter of how much life still has to offer you. I'm 44 and I'm ready for death, almost looking forward to it. I've had an extremely rough two years, and death sounds like a very tempting alternative to living. I'm not going to do anything crazy, but I hope life doesn't stay like this."
2596,1,trebek,"I've thought the same myself. As a younger person who wants to achieve a lot, I might feel better if I get a lot of it done."
2597,1,trebek,"But I think that's part of it though. When you reach 60/70, I think you will just look back fondly on the things you have achieved and not give a second thought to whatever you didn't achieve."
2598,1,trebek,"I loved his memoirs.  I cost myself an entire Sunday and a good night's sleep hammering it out in a single day.

Highly recommend."

2600,1,trebek,"I'm heartbroken.

My grandmother passed a little over a year ago and Jeopardy after dinner was our thing. This feels a like losing another piece of her. :("
2601,1,trebek,"Thats how I felt when Eddie Van Halen died. My dad was an outstanding guitar player and jammed like a rock star every evening in our basement to Van Halen. Eddie could make a guitar sing and my Dad practiced so hard that sometimes I swear he was even better than EVH.

Dad died of a heart attack 2.5 years ago. Its been devastating to our family and the fallout that happened after is impossible to even imagine. When Eddie died last month I felt like my Dad passed away all over again. But I know Dad was there at the pearly gates with an extra guitar in hand to welcome EVH.

Hugs to you. Losing a loved one is awful. Alex Trebek was a staple in my home growing up, Dad and I watched every night together. Im sure he was there to greet Alex as well as many other fans like your grandma.

ETA: thank you so much for the wholesome award u/unlikely--hero. Hugs to you!

ETA 2: An anonymous friendo gifted me a hug award. So kind! I expected wholesomeness on this thread since Alex
Trebek was an incredible person who touched the lives of many. What I never expected was to receive awards for sharing some of my story with you all. Hugs for everyone!!!"
2602,1,trebek,"I'm so sorry for your loss as well. I know exactly the kind of hole these losses can leave in a family. It leaves you feeling so untethered.

It's amazing, really, how some celebrities can become part of our lives in a really wholesome way. The mental image of his fans greeting him on the other side brings me joy and I appreciate you sharing it and the story about your dad. I am 100% sure he is having a jam session like you wouldn't believe."
2603,1,trebek,"Untethered is a perfect way to describe it. Youre right that celebrities can become like extended family members to us.

When Eddie died an ex of mine from 15 years ago texted me out of the blue (it was a cordial breakup but we havent spoken in years) sending condolences to my dad. I explained that he had passed away which made my ex even sadder... until I said that my family was actually *overjoyed* for my Dad.

His entire life Dad wanted to meet Eddie and tell him how much he meant to him. How his dream was to jam together and make their guitars sing. My family voted to forego Christmas and birthday presents several years in a row to afford front row seats to Van Halen concerts when they toured around 10-15 years ago with Sammy Hagar. That was the closest we came and as luck would have it our seats were directly in front of Eddie. Ive never seen my Dad so happy and now Im crying remembering that concert and looking at his expression of pure amazement. 

I never in my wildest dreams imagined that they would actually get to meet, and fairly soon, much less on the other side. When I hear rumbles in the sky for no reason Im convinced its them playing together. Makes me so happy, just the way imagining Alex Trebek was greeted by an endless walkway of fans clapping and cheering for him on makes me smile. 

My heart is heavy for our losses but Im genuinely happy for our loved ones. Who doesnt want to shake the hand of someone who meant so much to them? Theyre the lucky ones! Thank you for sharing your story and for reading mine. Didnt mean to go on and on haha but I guess I needed to get it out. So thanks for that &lt;3"
2604,1,trebek,"This is so sweet, much love to you and your father."
2605,1,trebek,"I live about 2 miles from EVHs childhood home (1881 Las Lunas, Pasadena, CA). I drove by to pay my respects a few weeks ago and there was a real cool ad hoc shrine set up on the sidewalk and parents were there with their kids to drop off flowers and other stuff. It was pretty damn cool to see."
2606,1,trebek,I used to love watching Jeopardy with my grandmother.  Even into her 80s she was sharp as a tack and devoted to Jeopardy and crossword puzzles.  Theres no doubt in my mind that Jeopardy played a part in keeping her mind nimble into her old age.  It improved her quality of life and helped set me on a life long path of loving trivia.  Trebek did so much good in the world.
2607,1,trebek,"8 years and 1 day since my grandma passed. Losing Alex is...more than losing Alex. I feel you, and Im sorry. RIP, Alex."
2608,1,trebek,"Thank you for your kind words and for sharing. It amazing to see all these people comment and put into words how much he meant to so many families.

 It never gets easier does it? It just changes."
2609,1,trebek,"It gets a little easier. I know it sounds callous to say that, my grandma raised me and was/is my best friend in the world. Truly believe I will never experience knowing someone like her ever again. She was a saint. The first few years were terrible. And she passed on my sisters birthday, so that was a nightmare  but then it helped. We knew shed rather us celebrate my sister and quietly remember her than spend every year absolutely miserable. All she ever wanted was for us to be happy and safe and okay, and I think we (my family) keep going just to honor that. It gets a little easier. I still wave and blow a kiss when I pass the place she lived (usually a few times a week) and while shes buried 8 hours away from me, I got to visit her last summer and it helped, as brutal as it was. 

It does get better. I think. Theres no timeline for grieving and it does come back in waves, but now I want to *live for her* rather than...expire because I am so distraught over her loss. I hope that makes sense. I hope your experience gets easier. It always hurts, but the fond memories are something no one can ever take from you.

Edit: when it hurts really bad, some days, I remind myself that she would be sooooo disappointed to see me in whatever great beyond she has found peace in  she was very catholic, I am not, but I believe she is in a better, beautiful place, and I know she wouldnt want me there with her. Not yet, at least. Ive got more living to do, unfortunately =D 
I look forward to seeing her one day, but I hope that time wont come for a while. P.S. if you ever need to chat, Im here. Clearly I love talking about my late grandmother, and I know the storm of pain and grief that comes with losing a grandparent. Dont hesitate to reach out if you need some support. Ill try my best. Lots of love to you and your family."
2610,1,trebek,Im right there with you. Some of my favorite memories with my grandma was just sitting around watching jeopardy in her living room.
2611,1,trebek,Nah dont worry! Your grandma is playing Jeopardy with Alex right now! Shes much happier.  Dont worry :)
2612,1,trebek,"I think I speak for many Americans when I say that Alex Trebek was a staple in our house for our entire lives.  

There will never be another game show host this beloved."
2613,1,trebek,"Same. I grew up with this man, he was probably the first voice I recognized. It feels like we lost a family friend even though I never met him."
2614,1,trebek,"Same. Im young but I still remember the moustache. My grandmother would straight up leave social engagements, appointments etc. to be home in time for Jeopardy"
2615,1,trebek,"Alex Trebek, Pat Sajak, and Bob Barker were always on in my household growing up as a kid. A terrible loss"
2616,1,trebek,He was a family friend to so many of us. Alex was who me and my partner sat down for dinner with almost every night. We will miss him so much.
2617,1,trebek,"Hundreds of evenings spent as a kid watching Pat Sajak and Alex Trebek back to back with my parents and brother. I learned so much from Jeopardy and to this day, I love random trivia because of Trebek. 

There might never be another *person* this beloved"
2618,1,trebek,This will ring true with an absolute ton of Midwesterners. I haven't watched Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy in years but the second I hear their voices I can pinpoint who it is.
2619,1,trebek,"Yup, this was definitely a familiar routine for me as a kid too, watched both shows back to back. Such a bummer he is gone from us."
2620,1,trebek,Hes right up there with Mister Rogers tbh
2621,1,trebek,Steve Irwin too.
2622,1,trebek,"I used to watch with my dad who knew so many of the questions. Ironically, my dad died from pancreatic cancer too."
2623,1,trebek,"When we moved five years ago, I advocated for getting cable since we couldnt figure out any other way to watch Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. Its something my entire family loves to do together. Its something my family loved to do growing up. My grandmother and I would watch Wheel of Fortune together when Id visit. 

Its definitely put a bitter taste to this week, but I already knew he was ready, and that helps. Im glad it was at home and with his family, and as peaceful as it could be. Hes lucky it was on his terms after a life well spent. We should all be so lucky."
2624,1,trebek,I think I speak for many Canadians when I say that he is one of our proudest exports
2625,1,trebek,"A sad day for Canada, and therefore the world."
2626,1,trebek,"As a Canadian, he was family. His death is felt beyond national borders."
2627,1,trebek,"Pat Sajak, Bob Barker, Alex Trebek. Legends"
2628,1,trebek,"Pat and Bob both have had some controversy, but Alex has never had a negative thing im aware of said about him."
2629,1,trebek,"I'm Jamaican, and I watched Jeopardy! almost everyday since I was a kid, till now. Before the pandemic when I was in office, my coworkers knew that when it was 5:00, they had to step aside to let me watch Jeopardy! to the point that they got into the habit as well. Alex will be missed."
2630,1,trebek,"A contestant was crying thinking about how much Alex meant to him growing up on the show just a few days ago. What a bummer.

RIP."
2631,1,trebek,Shed some tears to this clip. Jesus
2632,1,trebek,I think this was just on Reddit yesterday. What an emotional rollercoaster the past couple days have been.
2633,1,trebek,"It was, and I showed it to my wife and said why do I feel like 2020 is the type of year that would take Trebek from us? 

Well, screw you too 2020"
2634,1,trebek,Thats so sad to watch.  What a great man. RIP.

2637,1,trebek,Honestly theres something poetic about them dying within days of each other even though their feud only existed on SNL
2638,1,trebek,"In my heart of hearts, I'll always believe Trebek held out as long as he did out of spite."
2639,1,trebek,I'll take THE PENIS MIGHTIER for $200!

2643,1,trebek,Really?  Dude was 80 and had cancer prior to this year.  Many things to not like about this year but this was going to happen.
2644,1,trebek,Do you know how far advanced they film those episodes? He looked to lively on fridays episode. So sad.
2645,1,trebek,"Apparently Trebek episodes will air until late December, and his last day of taping was Oct 29.  So you're likely seeing how he was a couple of months ago.

Also remember with all the on-screen makeup and stuff, you can hide a lot of sickness."
2646,1,trebek,Christmas day is the last episode according to the producers.
2647,1,trebek,"There was also this [Jeopardy contestant that competed with colon cancer.](https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/entertainment/jeopardy-contestant-died-wins/index.html)

She was a 6 time champ, raised $100k+ for cancer research, but sadly passed away a week before it aired :("
2648,1,trebek,"Oh man, that is sad.  What a beautiful soul she was."
2649,1,trebek,"He left us a final Christmas present ="" it's amazing how dedicated he was to that show. I'm 35 and I've watched it almost my whole life. He was part of my childhood. I hope he knew how much of a staple he was in people's lives."
2650,1,trebek,"During the most recent ""teens"" tournament, one of the contestants, a really bright young man, had written a short thank you to Alex, for what he did, how he did it, and the integrity Alex has always shown. He wished him well in his battle with cancer. It was one of the only times I saw Alex tear up. I think that kid communicated better than anyone else could, Alex wasn't ""just"" a game show host, he really was so much more, and a human that deserves to be remembered."
2651,1,trebek,"October 29th was just over a week ago. While right now we're still seeing him pretty good, I can't imagine they would have kept filming if he was in bad shape. I'm wondering if this was a quick turn. :("
2652,1,trebek,"People often get ""better"" right before they die as their immune system shuts down. He might have been feeling really good in the days before his death."
2653,1,trebek,"It's incredible that he had the courage, will and ability to keep doing the job he loved up to mere days before his death. Really humbling."
2654,1,trebek,He apparently filmed through 10/29.
2655,1,trebek,"Well in advance. They tape 5 shows a week, but tape them all on one day so contestants are asked to bring multiple ties/suits/outfits. 

Source: dad was in jeopardy and won one day. 

They tape them somewhere between 3-4 months ahead if I remember correctly."
2656,1,trebek,Can definitely relate. I used to love watching Jeopardy with my family when I was younger. :(
2657,1,trebek,My wife and I have been watching the ones theyve been putting on Netflix. Hes an icon and will be missed.
2658,1,trebek,I saw that too. Hit me hard and made be miss having a relationship with my grandfather.
2659,1,trebek,"Alex is Daily Doubling in the sky now.

I've been watching him since I was three years old.

What a dude. You'll be missed Alex."
2660,1,trebek,(upbeat music)
2661,1,trebek,"I felt so horrible but I couldn't help but laugh a little at that subtitle over the man crying.

RIP Alex"
2662,1,trebek,"While I can't speak for Jeopardy If it helps you feel better they often film even game shows months in advance.

I've had many friends and relatives on Price is Right. And it's usually like a 9 month tape to air date"
2663,1,trebek,They do. The [show has said] (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michaelblackmon/alex-trebek-jeopardy-died) that the episodes already recorded will air up through Dec 25th. Not sure what will happen after that though.
2664,1,trebek,"I remember watching his show everyday at 4:30. My grandmother would always laugh when my answers were way off and applauded/praised me when they were correct


Jeopardy sparked a curiosity for learning in me.  I wouldnt have been interested in many after school programs if it werent for that show.  

Alex was greatly respected and will be missed.   
Irreplaceable.  RIP"
2665,1,trebek,Yeah and i distinctly remember someone saying they hope Alex makes it through 2020 cos that would be another horrible thing to add to the list to dooms year.
2666,1,trebek,"I have a story about Alex that I'd love to share.

So my mom and I have a tradition that we watch every jeopardy episode together. I grew up watching Jeopardy. Before the show starts, we always guess what colour tie Alex is going to wear. It's been a silly game we've played between us for years.

A few years ago for Christmas we decided to send him his own red tie with maple leafs on it since Alex is Canadian (so are we) and he actually wore it on the show. We read a [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/12/alex-trebek-stylist-phil-wayne) on it and apparently he wanted to work it into the show. We weren't expecting him to wear it on the show, we just wanted to share how much joy it gave my mom and I each night.

I'm really saddened by his passing. I applaud him for continuing the show even when he wasn't in good health. He was a really good man, made a ton of people so happy and did a lot for the trivia community. RIP Alex &lt;3

Edit: For anyone curious, [here's him in the tie](https://imgur.com/a/LELie9F). This was January 2016.  
Edit 2: Thank you for the gold! I'm glad the story is enjoyed!"
2667,1,trebek,Great story. Good memories.
2668,1,trebek,That is a wonderful story and really shows his gratitude to fans.
2669,1,trebek,That's a lovely story! So great that you and your mom can share that memory forever and that you got to make Alex's day!
2670,1,trebek,"Damn. This got me in the feels really hard as a Canadian in the USA. He was one of our best and brightest. 

Congratulations for making a difference in his life to this extent. Really. That is super special."
2671,1,trebek,Thats so awesome.
2672,1,trebek,"This is so special, thanks for sharing."
2673,1,trebek,Thank you for sharing this beautiful story. What a lovely memory for him to not only wear your tie but to be mentioned in an article.
2674,1,trebek,"GOAT game show host and fought such a brave and valiant battle. God bless your soul, Mr. Trebek. You will be missed."
2675,1,trebek,"For sure.  Although I almost don't really lump Jeopardy! in the ""game show"" category because, to me anyway, it was never cheesy like most other game shows and the hosts are.

Trebek and Monte Hall are two very different creatures."
2676,1,trebek,"Trebek's strength was his authenticity. You really got the feeling watching the show that you were seeing the real Alex Trebek every day. It wasn't a front or a character he ramped up for entertainment value. He seemed like a funny, witty, and genuinely kind man."
2677,1,trebek,Someone said on Twitter that he was the perfect mix of stoic and playful. Couldn't agree more.
2678,1,trebek,So he was Canadian through and through
2679,1,trebek,"For sure. It was the only game show Ive ever tried to actually be on because it was like a legit competition rather than some gimmicky game show. I dont think Ill try again now that hes gone, it just wont be the same."
2680,1,trebek,"Over the years I've had a lot of people tell me I should try out.  I never really gave it much serious thought, but usually playing along while watching I get most of the questions right."
2681,1,trebek,"One of the most iconic television personalities of *ALL TIME*..

Who is Alex Trebek? 

Rest In Peace, sir. Well miss you."
2682,1,trebek,"&gt; 20th/21st centuries

So of all time?"
2683,1,trebek,We can't forget those electric TV  personalities from the 19th century
2684,1,trebek,"This question will appear on an episode presented by Electrozander Qubit on an episode of Jeopardy on Tuesday, July 27, 2399. 

The question remains correct at that date."
2685,1,trebek,Those TV personalities from the 15th century were pretty good.
2686,1,trebek,"I had the pleasure of meeting him. I auditioned for Teen Tournament, drove up to Thousand Oaks for the try out, memorized every president and state capitol on the way just in case. We were all herded into a college lecture hall.

It started with a paper quiz about random stuff with a few personal questions - these questions did matter as cool stories make good TV. I aced the quiz and had a cool story (running into my dad at Stonehenge despite neither of us planning to be there that day) and I signed every i with a smilie face instead of the dot - maybe something as simple as that is what made me stand out. 

Those of us who passed the paper quiz then got to play with the buzzers. There's actually a slight delay and that's why you see people mashing the buzzers on TV. They coached us on that and reiterated how to answer questions.

 After a round of that, HE came out and did some Q&amp;A with each of us - TV presence really factored into their picks and we realized it here. Because I had used smilie faces, he started calling me Ms Smilie and I got called up over and over again for test rounds. He did a mock interview for the top candidates so I got to tell my personal story and we were coached in how to make the story pop - looking back, maybe my story was silly, but it was quick and made for good TV, as we practiced the back and forth q/a with Trebek. 

He really liked me and kept referring to me as Ms Smilie through the whole thing. It was really fun and exciting, coming from someone who always watched the show!

I got a phone call about a month later - teen tournament had been pushed back 2 months and I unfortunately hit the age cutoff because of that. They had wanted me but their own rules disqualified me. They were very sorry and sent me a baseball hat instead. I still own it and wear it!"
2687,1,trebek,"Well put.

Grew up watching Mr. Trebek. Unflappable, dignified gentleman."
2688,1,trebek,I thought we had more time. I didn't expect this so soon.
2689,1,trebek,I feel like a piece of my daily life is gone. Breaks my heart.
2690,1,trebek,"Same here. Watched with my parents daily. Guy lived it long and good. Alex, keep rocking it out there my dude."
2691,1,trebek,I've been watching Jeopardy my entire life with Alex as the host. This really sucks.
2692,1,trebek,"Same. I never missed an episode for the past 15 years or so. The ones I couldn't catch, I'd DVR. I spent every evening with him. Mr. Trebek is a once in a lifetime kind of person and we are all beyond lucky that we had him in our lives.  
I am truly devastated."
2693,1,trebek,"He was fighting for almost 2 years. My condolences to his family and friends.The fact that he kept working despite having cancer makes him even more legendary.
FUCK CANCER"
2694,1,trebek,"I'm glad he got to receive some of that public appreciation during his final years too, during his battle. The guy writing ""We love you Alex"" during his Final Jeopardy answer; having the best three Jeopardy contestants of all-time battle it out together in primetime; writing a memoir to summarize what he wanted said. 

Not many of us get that chance, but he did and he took advantage of it. Hope it serves him well on his next journey, wherever that leads. But we'll miss him."
2695,1,trebek,"Not gonna say I'm crying, but...

https://youtu.be/-McR3sBWNRA"
2696,1,trebek,Him and Chadwick Boseman
2697,1,trebek,Fuck cancer indeed.
2698,1,trebek,"My sister had stage 4 pancreatic cancer that she passed from 8 years ago. His diagnosis last spring and the hope from his initial treatment working was almost identical to what we went through with my sister. Pancreatic Cancer is no joke. Its the fourth biggest cancer killer by shear numbers every year, and yet its on the bottom of the list for new yearly diagnoses. The 5 year survival rate is still only around 9% regardless of when it is discovered. 

There are plenty of charities out there dedicated to fighting it, with the [Pancreatic Cancer Action Network](https://www.pancan.org/) works hard in DC to lobby for pancreatic cancer research funding. They have a great rating and are really doing a great job."
2699,1,trebek,I also recommend the [Lustgarten Foundation](Https://lustgarten.org). More of the donations to them go to research and resources for patients and families.
2700,1,trebek,Lustgarten is also a fabulous organization.
2701,1,trebek,Absolute legend. Fuck cancer. Rest in peace Mr. Trebek
2702,1,trebek,He will be dearly missed. I can't imagine Jeopardy without him.
2703,1,trebek,"What a loss. This clip always got me, but it hits so much harder today:

We d you, Alex. RIP"
2704,1,trebek,Wow you can hear his voice break.
2705,1,trebek,I've probably watched that clip 15 times since it happened.
2706,1,trebek,Devastating news.. Rest In Peace to an icon.
2707,1,trebek,he quite obviously didnt like the idea of sean connery being alone with his mother.
2708,1,trebek,"He was just a genuinely good dude. Smart, funny, and a stache that wouldn't quit.  From classic concentration way back to making jeopardy, and intelligence, a popular thing worldwide.
The epitome of Canadian spirit and values, IMHO.

I grew up trying to answer more than my dad every weekday evening.  Ive been watching for 30 years, I guess, now.

This makes me terribly sad.  Last celebrity I remember shedding a tear for was Cobain so long ago.

Goodbye, friend."
2709,1,trebek,"He transcended the celebrity status imo, he was super famous but seemed so normal. I've never watched a full episode of Jeopardy but I fell in love with his story after he refused to give up after his diagnosis."
2710,1,trebek,He was so much more than a celebrity.  He was a member of millions of families all across America.
2711,1,trebek,"Fame is something that comes and goes. Even the biggest celebrities will sometimes leave the spotlight. But not Trebek. He wasn't famous, he was ever present."
2712,1,trebek,"Because even if you never watched an episode of Jeopardy! you *still* know who he is. Kind of like even if you never listened to a single Elvis song, you still know who he is."
2713,1,trebek,"I owe this man a huge debt of gratitude for all the knowledge and comfort he's given me in my lifetime. 

I learned English by watching Jeopardy starting from when my parents left the former USSR. We watched jeopardy constantly and I grew up side by side with the program. Through the seasons and my changing ages, sick days and family problems I always had this show to curl up and watch. 

Mr Trebek comforted me in some very hard acclimation periods while moving back and forth across the world, learning new languages and adjusting to strange cultures and I could always count on his program to expand my mind and fill the void I felt with his nightly new facts and tiny bits of information that I could then chase down and unravel into fascinating new areas of study. 


May he rest in peace and feel comfort knowing even half the impact he made on myself and others around the world."
2714,1,trebek,"Holy shit dude, this is really close to my story too! I'd rent jeopardy episodes on betamax to 'learn about American culture' because I wanted to someday move here.

Happy to meet someone else that this happened to!"
2715,1,trebek,"Did you also get incredibly proud when a question about your home country or culture would come up and you could get it right and none of the contestants could? 

We are a mixed (Slav-MENA) Jewish family so we always were really happy to feel represented by the questions. That wasn't as common back in those days, or so it felt like.  

Glad to hear your story too."
2716,1,trebek,"Haha. Of course! Many times in the 80s, it felt like the rest of the world didn't know where we were. I would settle for a vague mention of 'Southeast Asia"""
2717,1,trebek,"This hurts. Rest In Peace to an absolute legend. 

His charisma as the Jeopardy host (and the best game show host ever) was a factor in me becoming so interested in learning about anything as a kid and that has extended to adulthood. He will be missed."
2718,1,trebek,"I propose that Trebek be canonized along Bob Ross, Steve Irwin, and Mr. Rogers for his earnest love of trivia and gamesmanship"
2719,1,trebek,What is He Will Be Missed?
2720,1,trebek,"That is correct, we also would have accepted ""what is Fuck Cancer?"""

2729,1,trebek,"Oh wow thanks to this comment I remembered they were both a common part of that SNL Jeopardy parody. What a coincidence, even though they really didn't have any direct influence on the skit it was a rivalry that had my sides splitting often."
2730,1,trebek,itd really be something if hammond and ferrell returned this weekend to pay tribute in a final sketch dedicated to them.  might be the first snl sketch to make me cry from poignancy rather than laughter
2731,1,trebek,"Ferrell's Trebek entering heaven, Hammond's Cononery on the other side, ""what are you doing here, Trebek? I thought the gays go to hell!!! Uh-uhuhuhuh...! By the way, your mom ish here and she shays hi, I've been bangin' her shince I arrived! UH-uhuhuhuh!!!"""

This gave me a much needed laugh, that joke (Sorry gay people I support you) was so fitting for those skits I'm questioning if it's from one and I don't remember it. 
  
Thanks"
2733,1,trebek,"If SNL doesn't bring back Darrel Hammond and Will Farrel for a sketch they're wasting a golden opportunity. 


Tonight on Celebrity Jeopardy! Heaven edition: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Eddie Van Halen and Sean Connery! 

Trebek: Thank you for joining us tonight on Celebrity Jeopardy, Heaven edition. I'm your host, Alex Trebek and I'm apparently going to be doing this for all eternity.

2759,1,trebek,"I don't know if it would gauche or flattering, but I kind of want a SNL Jeopardy sketch set in heaven with him, Connery, and Burt Reynolds."
2760,1,trebek,"They need to go balls-out with it, then retire the bit forever."
2761,1,trebek,"Its really the worst.

When my brother was 8 and 4 years deep into leukemia, Make a Wish came to him.

At first he was excited, then after he made a wish, to go to Disney World, they told him he was too sick. It hit him that this was the last thing he could get that our family would never afford. So he asked for a swimming pool thinking from a child's mind.
They brought him a plastic wading pool.

He cried so much. Eventually I think someone gave him a Super Nintendo. However he lived for 2 more years and never again thought he was going to survive it."
2762,1,trebek,What is pain

2771,1,trebek,Before he passed he got to know just how much everybody loved him.
2772,1,trebek,"When I was in High School in the 80s, I kind of fell apart because of being socially awkward, and my grades suffered.  My parents habitually watched Jeopardy,  and it became a game for us to try to shout out the answers.  I became kind of obsessed with beating them all, and as a result I started reading everything I could on science, literature, mathematics and history.  It turned me around, I joined my schools academic quiz bowl team, and dominated competitions.  Went on to graduate from a University with honors in History and Political Science.  It wasnt until today that I realized how much of that I owe to Jeopardy and Mr. Trebek.  Thank you Alex, you will be missed."
2773,1,trebek,"Fucking awesome, man. Hell yes. And yay you."
2774,1,trebek,"Interestingly, the longer I've lived with the cancer,†the more my definition of† toughness has changed. I used to think not crying meant you were tough. Now I think†crying†means you're tough. It means you're strong enough to be honest and vulnerable. It means you're not pretending...

But it is by no means a fair fight.†Not even close.†It is simple biology.†You get treatment and you get better.†Or you don't.†And neither outcome is an indication of your strength as a person. Yet I still believe in the will to live.†I believe in positivity.†I believe in optimism.†I believe in hope,†and I certainly believe in the power of prayer...

My life has been a quest for knowledge and understanding, and I'm nowhere near having achieved that. And it doesn't bother me in the least.†I†will†die†without†having†come† up with†the† answer to many things in life. I'm often asked how I would like to be remembered.†I don't think about it much.

But I suppose if I had to answer I would say I'd like to be remembered first of all as a good†and loving†husband and father, and also as a decent man who did his best to help people perform at their best. Because that was my job.†That is what a host is supposed to do.

Yep, I'll be perfectly content if that's how my story ends: sitting on the swing with the woman I love,†my soul mate,†and our two wonderful†children†nearby.†I'll†sit there†for†a†while†and†then†maybe the four of us will go for a walk,† each day trying to walk a little farther than the last.† We'll take things one step at a time,†one day at a time.

Then, a family friend of ours found out he had pancreatic cancer two weeks ago and died a week later. 

I admired Alex Trebec for the way he handled the diagnosis. His death is just a reminder of how terrible this cancer can be, and to embrace every day that we are given. My thoughts are with his family."
2792,1,trebek,Fuck this year holy shit
2793,1,trebek,RIP to a true Canadian legend.
2794,1,trebek,"My twin brother is special needs and looks forward to watching Jeopardy everyday. And I mean every day. It's part of his routine. He's high functioning verbal and has a killer memory and love for all things TV, so when he gets an occasional answer right his face just lights up. Alex and Jeopardy have been a part of my family's lives since I was a kid. I grew up watching it with my parents and even now at 36 find myself watching it. He will be sorely missed. Goodnight, Canadian TV trivia grandpa."
2795,1,trebek,"What a class act Alex Trebek was! He inspired my son Joseph!

Have a cute story to tell. It was 2004, and Ken Jennings was on Jeopardy. My son, who was a kindergartener at the time, loved to watch Jeopardy every night with me. Well, picture day was coming up, and he insisted that he absolutely have a shirt and tie for picture day, since that is what Ken Jennings mostly wears on the show. 

So, off to Sears we go in search of a shirt and tie. I wish I could add the resulting kindergarten picture of a little boy with a blue shirt and red tie, who loved Alex Trebeck and Ken Jennings. RIP Alex Trebek!

PS. That little boy of mine is now 23 and studying at Arcadia College to be a lawyer!

Edit: don't know why it spelled it Trebeck right after the real spelling of Trebek. Apologies."

2833,1,trebek,"I said to my wife the moment he announced his cancer, of all the celebrity deaths, when his time comes, his will hurt the most. With his upbeat attitude I had only hope that he would beat it. As a Canadian, A Jeopardy fan and as a human being, I feel his loss deeply. This is one of the worst things to not only happen during 2020, but to television and the pursuit of knowledge and education. I may not be Jeopardy material, but getting an answer or two right when watching the show makes you feel unstoppable. I sincerely hope the best for his family, friends, fans and loved ones during this tough time.

Rest in peace, Mr. Trebek."

2837,1,trebek,"Growing up, my father used to watch Jeopardy every night. He would get almost every question right, often before the contestant could buzzer in (hed also always form it into a question, like the show) and Id always ask him, when are you gonna go on and make us some money?

My father died in 2006, due to complications from the AIDS virus. I like to imagine him being there to welcome Alex into Heaven/the Afterlife and now they can finally have their own personal round of Jeopardy. This is bittersweet because while we lost one of the greats, like my father, Alex isnt in pain anymore."
2838,1,trebek,"I grew up watching Alex on Jeopardy with my dad every night, still one of my favourite parts of coming home. I just cant imagine who they could get to try to replace him.

2842,1,trebek,"This is one man that you can never say ""lost his battle to cancer"". In a fight like that, even if you know you can't beat it, you've gotta make the most of it, and he did that very thing. Wishing him forever peace and rest. We lost a beautiful soul today."
2843,2,epstein,"Not just an island, but a ranch in New Mexico (un-raided)

 Not just suicide, suicide in the same prison El Chapo was kept ON SURVEILLANCE. 

Both guards were asleep apparently, then and or removed at the time, they cant get their story straight.

Cell mate removed prior to.

Screaming or yelling heard prior to him hanging *himself*?

Cameras malfunctioned.

But really he just escaped earlier via body double replacing him. Who by the way has none of the same features except for similar skin tone and hair color. 

You think this dude this powerful didnt have a escape plan, a plan B? You think any of this went as reported? All a rouse. Fall guy didnt even have to fall.

This was the plan all along. Tensions rising due to Weinstein getting called out, cracks in their pedo fortress begin to leak bits and pieces of truth.

Get someone SUPER important, visibly send him to jail, make it seem the pedo world is built on his shoulders, have him kill himself before trial.

Nails in the coffin, media silence, gets off Scott free.

Edit:  updated the part about him screaming or yelling prior to him hanging *himself*.

EDIT:  ALL the sources below, minus all the things I didnt even bring up here."
2844,2,epstein,Can I see a source on the body double part?
2845,2,epstein,"Ill dig it up. 

Images of the body removed from the scene dont match Epsteins dimensions. Primarily they focus on the INCREDIBLE change in the entire size of his ear.

Edit: One good example: 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/AFwithNJF/comments/cprbu6/proof_of_the_epstein_body_double/

I like the comment. ""What master blackmailer wouldnt have a body double and a dead mans switch"""
2846,2,epstein,"The only images I'm aware of were supplied by a journalist who also released the photoshopped picture of Ghislaine Maxwell eating at In-n-Out after Epstein ""killed himself"", which was likely an op to cover her escape from the US on the other side of the country, where she was apparently staying with a tech billionaire in Manchester by the Sea. That same journalist was also an advisor on Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut and was the first person to report Kubrick's death.

So I don't know what to make of that, but that journalist who released the image of Epstein's body being taken away from the prison has a lot of weird shit surrounding them."
2847,2,epstein,Who is this journalist?
2848,2,epstein,Larry Celona
2849,2,epstein,Have you seen the movie Eyes Wide Shut? Spoiler Alert but Larry was the  journalist in the who reported on the cover up overdose death of a model in the film. It apparently has underage sex portrayed and the director died 6 days after releasing final cut. Also reported by Larry.
2850,2,epstein,"She most definitely was arrested in MBTS.... the police never have anything to do here, almost all the tickets they write are traffic tickets, so when she was getting arrested it was a HUGE THING.... wish I knew where his mansion was in my town so I could go take some shit... you dont stay with someone who isnt apart of it..."
2851,2,epstein,Those two features are pretty significant to show that they are most certainly not the same person. Ear shape almost never changes throughout an individuals life especially that much in the antihelix...and I doubt he was going to get a rhinoplasty or significant plastic surgery in prison...
2852,2,epstein,Actually ear shape does change throughout someone's lifespan as it's cartilage and grows constantly that's why old people have big ears and noses
2853,2,epstein,"While yes they do grow with age and gravity they hardly change shape in the antihelix and crux of the antihelix very rarely throughout life. Generally the lobe and helix change due to aging. Noses are weird and can be difficult to find similarities with changes in picture angle/quality but that curvature wouldn't have changed that drastically even in a couple years let alone the time that he was convicted to his 'death'.

Source: Background in facial identification. By no means am I an expert but even a basic can figure this out."
2854,2,epstein,That's fair
2855,2,epstein,"have you ever seen someone doing MMA and watched his ears ?

their ears look like cauliflowers and that happens because of the blood bursts in your ear

i can imagine that if you hanged yourself something similar happens 

doesnt sound totally impossible"
2856,2,epstein,"Not the same, but that's how cats get cauliflower ears, is by their blood vessels in the ear bursting and killing the ear. Ears are delicate when it comes to some types of things."
2857,2,epstein,"Firstly, to prevent an emotional response from people, I will say that this case is definitely intriguing and suspicious.  I would love to believe this particular claim because of the implications if it were true, however,  the facial features look the same as the ""original"" and the only reason the ear looks like it does is because of livor mortis, followed by rigor mortis. If you think about it, no one has ever claimed a body double based on a corpse's appearance for exactly that reason, after death significant swelling and distortion takes place. I would have to see some more evidence to believe this."
2858,2,epstein,"The image was taken between 1 and 2 hours after his death.

The two parts here that are different are soft bones, so I dont know if this could be a reason why the shape changes here. Especially that there arent even soft bones at the tip of the nose (mine actually doesnt).

Any forensic here to give us hindsight ? Can the shape of the soft bones be changed after the death when the skin is retracting ? How long would it take ?"

Is there actually any evidence that suggests Epstein himself didn't pay off the guards (warden, whoever else required) to look the other way so he could kill himself?  Or maybe just an angle I'm missing?

To me it seems just as likely.  Guy was fucked, maybe he didn't want to live the rest of his life in jail so he said fuck it and kicked some money to whoever he needed to (who probably wanted him dead anyway) and asked them to look the other way.

Not concern trolling, legit curious."
2880,2,epstein,"Truth is stranger than fiction, but no there's not really factual evidence for anything other than his death which even that can be debated. A lot of circumstantial evidence that can raise a lot of red flags but nothing definitive to say foul play or your scenario

IMO a guy connected like that has a dead-man switch so that no one can get rid of him, he goes down they all go down. Maybe they convinced him to take the fall silently, a ""life has been good"" scenario? Did they not risk it and silence him? Idk. Zero evidence but I think they faked his death and he's still alive out there somewhere, it's not like he didn't have the connections to do so"

The mainstream media is not reporting on this story nearly enough. Epstein is connected in a web of elites like you wouldn't believe. First there needs to be a massive investigation and reporters need to start covering it.

Serious questions need to be asked of news agencies not giving this the light of day. This is huge news but because he is so well connected it's being buried. 

I've heard Epstein was compromising influential people with underage women. How many in the media are compromised?  

Where's the investigation? Where's the mainstream news coverage? Where's the public outrage? Demand an investigation! Ask your representitives and favorite entertainers why they aren't talking about this more?? I want to know who Epstein was working for."
2922,2,epstein,"We saw what happened to the journalist who reported on the Panama Papers. Murdered in her driveway in a car bomb, gangland mafia style. 

Epstein's murder proves that the ultra-wealthy and well connected can get away with anything. And nothing is going to change that.

In fact, I think it's only going to get worse unless there's a French Revolution kind of rebellion. Which I don't think will ever happen."
2923,2,epstein,"If anyone wants real progress, this is what needs to be protested. Domestic propaganda, five eyes, warrantless wiretapping, etc. Once all that is back in order is when you go after the next layers of corruption.

All these fun little government loopholes. Funny, when the citizens do this it's a bad thing, but they sure do love using them themselves."
2924,2,epstein,"Worked in intelligence community in the UK and this is exactly what happens. The reason the UK-US has such a special relationship? Well if you want to spy on your own citizens you need a warrant from a judge and the bar (rightly) is set very high to get those warrants. However, to spy on a foreign national allows a much lower bar. So if The US wants to spy on on of its citizens, that persons details are passed onto GCHQ  who conduct whatever surveillance is necessary and pass it in to NSA, or whoever asked for it. This has been happening for years, probably decades."
2925,2,epstein,"Yeah thats literally what FE was set up to achieve. The mass surveillance of participating nations populace without having to break any laws. 

And its not just names that are passed on, its everything, they hooked you up to a firehose with aevery shred of information shared on the internet and meta data on everyone. Then you connected this up to powerful systems (sold to us by the yanks and then customised) both hardware and software which can run incredible analysis of data at rates humans could never achieve. Pulling all the right pieces into Kite (Palantir) which has since been heavily customised by ATR (applied research). You failed to mention that NSA gave GCHQ access to said firehose so they could spy on Americans. It wasnt just names passed on it was everything.

2949,2,epstein,Conspiracy theorists and reactionary thought have gone together like a hand in glove since the start. The O.G. conspiracy theory was Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
2950,2,epstein,"Because the difference between Clinton and Trump ties to Epstein is that Bill Clinton was (apparently) best friends with Epstein and flew on his underage sex plane at least 20 times, while Trump has a few pictures at public parties with him.

It's completely different, yet the monstrosities that stray from r/politics into this sub try to make it look like it's the same.

That said, I wish for *everyone* who took part in Epstein's human trafficking operations to go down."
2951,2,epstein,Guarantee you won't get a reply from them acknowledging their selective memory here...
2952,2,epstein,"Trump appointed Acosta to the White House administration, the same prosecutor that got Epstein the lenient deal when he first got arrested in Florida, and then swept everything under the rug, making sure the investigation didn't go any further.

You think it's a coincidence? These people all ran in the same circles."
2953,2,epstein,"Epstein and Bill Clinton wasnt talked about by anyone in the MSM, but once it was forced into public spotlight it was all about Trump. Weird how the people who refused to cover Epstein now insist it was really Trump raping kids the whole time."
2954,2,epstein,"You mean President Trump, the guy that knew Epstein, knew about his love of underaged girls, shared his love of underaged girls... and hired to the government the guy that got Epstein off?

and you mean Barr, the head of the department of justice which oversees all federal prisons?


nah, it has to be Clinton that did it."
2955,2,epstein,"Mainstream media reports didn't misrepresent those relationships.  You could get by on fluffy infotainment alone and still know that Trump and Barr were a part of this despicable network.  To the extent some of those other figures were mentioned at all, it was to lend credibility to disavowals subsequently proven to be at odds with hard evidence."
2956,2,epstein,I haven't read too deeply into Barr's connections with the man but from what I've seen Trump hasn't been in close contact with Epstein for over a decade now and there hasn't been any hard evidence that the President was involved with Epsteins nastier side. I have no doubts that the two had some pretty disgusting events together but I've yet to see Trump linked directly to the sex trafficking ring. If anyone has a link to an article I'll gladly read it though.
2957,2,epstein,"well, trump knew about Epstein's love of young girls and trump shared in the love. he has publically bragged about going backstage on his underaged teen beauty pagant."
2958,2,epstein,"Why did Trump appoint Acosta to the White House administration, then? That wasn't decades ago, that was very recent. Same Acosta that covered up the first Epstein investigation and got him a 13 month sentence (which he served half in his own office).

Open your eyes Trump is just as implicated as the rest of them. Did he diddle kids? I don't know. Was he OK with it and worked with Epstein because $$$? Yes, most definitely."
2959,2,epstein,"Man if I knew, I probably wouldnt be commenting on reddit. Everything about Epstein is web upon web of fucked up dirt from the past 40 years. Could simply be that dirty hires dirty. Theres not a doubt in my mind that trump was aware of Epsteins habits, but without hard evidence to conclusively link him to any of Epsteins crimes theres no point in debating whether or not he should be included with the known offenders in this situation."
2960,2,epstein,"I'm not saying Trump committed any crimes with Epstein. I'm not trying to link him to Epstein's kid diddling. I'm just saying they ran in the same circles, and Acosta did a great service to Epstein (and got a Secretary of Labor position from Trump).

It's how politics works. Somebody does you a favor, you help them out, now they're Sec of Labor and they help you out in the future. It could have been an associate of Epstein that ended up making a deal with Trump to score him the nomination.

Obviously all speculation but one thing is clear and that is that and Epstein ran in the same circles. They knew each other. They partied with each other. And Trump hired Acosta (florida prosecutor for Epstein's 1st court case) as his Secretary of Labor."
2961,2,epstein,"Oh yeah, all of that is definetly true. However my original comment was a reply to someone asking why trump was not included in a link list of people connected with the kid diddling circle, not that Trump didnt know Epstein or that they didnt run in the same circle."
2962,2,epstein,I mean honestly neither is the non mainstream media. Its not talked about on right wing or left wing fringe media either.
2963,2,epstein,You've got the guns - use them.
2964,2,epstein,"Can't help but notice Trump, who notoriously called Epstein a great guy and knew he ""likes them young"" and was the president under whose administration this guy was mysteriously offed, isn't on your list."
2965,2,epstein,"Lol.

If theres one thing Im fucking sick of anymore, its that bullshit."
2966,2,epstein,You literally pick Fox News as your sources? And still going at Clinton even though trump has ties also?
2967,2,epstein,"Lol it's hysterically ironic that this was your response, to sometime who stated that things won't change, because the two sides are too divided to unite for desperate needs. *You just point at Clinton.* Lol. 

Trump is just as likely as Clinton to be a pedophile. The difference is, liberals will say they are open to investigating and arresting Clinton if it's accurate. If Trump were, conservatives would call it a deep state coup. 

This, beyond anything else, is your problem with Trump; the inability to see or admit anything bad in him, and the refusal to hold him accountable for anything he says or does. That shit's dangerous."

Sure the consumerism does not help, especially for kids in poor families who compare themselves to what others have at school. I wouldnt go so far to say the vast majority of people arent poor.

Furthermore, if you ""succeed"" and have a great income much if the things you will then go enjoy rely on other people's suffering. This is not succeeding to me and I don't want to be a part of the cycle.

So then why?"
2983,2,epstein,"He explains that in detail on the Rogan podcast. It's an excellent podcast worth watching.

Basically, everyone ""knew"" but no one could prove it. That meant the former head of the NSA could (and did) lie to congress and deny bulk collection is taking place. Snowden actually brings up a clip on the podcast (one of only 2-3 supplements he used during the 3 hour interview) of said NSA director being asked by a congressman something to the tune of ""Is the NSA bulk collecting and storing data on American citizens?"" and the dude just flat lies and says ""no."" The congressman knew he was lying, but had no way to pursue it further.

Snowden explains that the gap between ""everyone *knows*"" and ""everyone can cite the proof"" is the most important gap that exists in political discourse. It's literally everything.

He saw his opportunity to be the one who would make it impossible for these people to lie to the American public about this. Without his effort, we might still have the head of the NSA sitting in front of congress assuring us all that the American people's right to privacy is being respected."
2984,2,epstein,Citizen four is a seriously legitimate documentary that everyone should see..
2985,2,epstein,"Same here. And we even have sub reddits like r/enlightenedcentrism that mocks people who refuse to choose a side.

I honestly judge a person's critical thinking by how much they buy into political BS. If they don't belong to a political party, but are still well informed about politics and the issues. Then odds are they're a very intelligent person.

Most people just pick a side and repeat sound bites and talking points, and don't actually know the issues, especially economic ones. This is why people get so fired up about social issues, they tend to be clear cut and easy to understand where as healthcare and taxes are complicated and messy."
2986,2,epstein,"Enlightenedcentrism is really about making fun of centrists anymore its about making of right wingers claiming theyre moderates.

I agree with you strongly though, I greatly prefer someone has a conviction I disagree with that they came to critically on their own than one I agree with they have simply because their side told them too.

Difference of opinion is a great thing if the reasons for that opinion is more than its what my side thinks or its the opposite of what the other side thinks."
2987,2,epstein,This is the first time I've heard of this sub and after a brief scan I agree. It's a right-bad left-good sub and if you're neither they just claim you're a right wing delusionist.
2988,2,epstein,"Eh it's more about mocking those who believe a moderate position is good by virtue of it being moderate, and then claiming their position is moderate and trying to push everyone elses opinions as ""extremism"". They're certainly left of center as a whole though."
2989,2,epstein,"&gt; Then odds are they're a very intelligent person.

I disagree with this. Being led by your biases has little to do with one's intelligence. It has more to do with your humility and accepting the fact that you're susceptible to subtle manipulations. No matter how informed you believe yourself to be, odds are you're still misinformed, because the ""truth"" was never revealed to begin with."
2990,2,epstein,"They tend to be clear cut and easy to understand. I agree with everything you said but that. Social issues are incredibly complex, if they were simple we wouldnt really have them, as people generally mean well."
2991,2,epstein,Theres a difference between not choosing a side and moderates or people taking the blind stance of bOth sIdEs arE eqUaL¸.
2992,2,epstein,"I tend to decide if I like a specific policy based on it's own merits. For example healthcare.

I'm for medicare for all because I experienced our corrupt healthcare system first hand multiple times, and want it changed. But I don't want government ran healthcare because the government is very inefficient at running things.

Medicare for all seems like a nice compromise with the government provided insurance saying we won't pay these ridiculous prices. Of course the healthcare industry hates it because they will lose the extortion racket they currently have, but they'll just have to adapt."
2993,2,epstein,"Government inefficiency is really overstated.  It does some things extremely well and efficiently, such as social security and SNAP.  The health care that it runs, the VA, has higher satisfaction ratings than private insurers and hospitals.  There are definitely threats of self dealing and corruption (which also occurs in privately and publicly held companies as well) and auditing and anti-corruption efforts are very important to address them."
2994,2,epstein,Except Medicare is more efficient at getting healthcare for money than insurance agencies. It's proven that insurance is less efficient than government run healthcare.
2995,2,epstein,Because a huge amount of healthcare is given out without the free market. If I shoot you in the leg you're not shopping around for someone to take out the bullet or worrying if the doctor is in network.
2996,2,epstein,"...and Medicare for all is left, it is Democratic. Vote Democratic.

Wait all day for the revolution to start, point out all the corruption and conspiracy regardless of who does it...but vote Dem, and improve millions of lives while doing so."
2997,2,epstein,"At the end of the day, with corruption rampant on both sides, I have chosen to side with the people who are pushing policies that improve the lives of people I care about.

The Dems aren't Jesus. They are as Machiavellian as the repubs, they just are using betterment as a way to prop up their support.

I'd love a three party system, but since it ain't gonna happen, I'll vote for the better side and demand we police them way more than ever before.

Anyone supporting concentration camps doesn't have a ""difference of opinion""; they aren't human."
2998,2,epstein,"
&gt;I'd love a three party system, but since it ain't gonna happen, I'll vote for the better side and demand we police them way more than ever before.
&gt;

There are democratic politicians (and ONLY democratic politicians) that support ending Citizene United AND the Electoral College AND First Past the Post. That would lead to a multiparty system with a hell of a lot less corporate influence.

But surely the dems are just as bad as the republicans, right? Nevermind that 3 democratic presidential candidates have openly suggested those kinds of structural changes."
2999,2,epstein,"One thing that i have noticed is that the common citizen finds it hard find accurate, unbiased information to help guide thier decisions. They only see the ads , Facebook posts or other biased information/propaganda and either go along with it or get overwhelmed and dont even vote because they dont know enough.


Many of our western media outlets are owned by people with thier own agenda and finding and independent, accurate source that a layman can understand is actually very very difficult. 

I know I do my best to try to read up on current issues but it takes a lot of time and s lot of independent research to verify claims or information. We need more independent journalists to help inform the people that vote."
3000,2,epstein,"WaPo, The Hill, NYT, and other journalism based news sources exist.  Corporate ownership of news sources is acceptable when they act as investments instead of as mouth pieces and mouth pieces as news sources is a bad thing.  Breitbart, for example, is a mouth piece.  WaPo, for example, has seen primarily changes in how their news is funded and not how their news is skewed or operates.

The common citizen chooses info-tainment because its easier to digest and supports their narrative.  People don't accidentally land in white nationalist news sources, they seek them out."
3001,2,epstein,"Einstein said this in ""Why Socialism?"""
3002,2,epstein,I mean they are mostly right though. Its not against centrists. Its against republicans masquerading as Centrists or people who really dont notice the extreme hypocrisy or discrepancies in their views.
3003,2,epstein,"&gt;Same here. And we even have sub reddits like [r/enlightenedcentrism](https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenedcentrism) that mocks people who refuse to choose a side.

It's mocking people who say both parties are exactly the same. And saying both parties are the same is usually done when a conservative does something bad."
3004,2,epstein,"""I just don't know who to support. On one hand the left wants to let trans people use the bathroom of their choice, but the right is separating families and abusing children en masse.""

Division sucks, but allowing shit like this to go on sucks more. People shouldn't be compromising on their humanity just so you can protest with other people"
3005,2,epstein,"More like ""I just don't know who to support. On one hand the left is a cesspool of corruption that pretends to be the 'good guys' to gain the public support of the indignant populace, and on the other the right is also a cesspool of corruption that pretends to be morally correct in order to appease their brainwashed Christian supporters"""
3006,2,epstein,"Well, empirically, the brainwashed Christian supporters are supporting the more corrupt side.

Also separating families, mass child abuse etc etc"
3007,2,epstein,The voters in Canada act the same way and it's tiring. Fucking vote for the country not for 'your side'. What the fuck do they think they vote for?
3008,2,epstein,"Careful now with that kind of madness, youll get those lovely intelligent r/politics folks blaming *you* for Trump being elected!"
3009,2,epstein,How
3010,2,epstein,"Exactly. The ruling class is bipartisan, so any effective resistance against them must also be bipartisan."
3011,2,epstein,Divide and conquer
3012,2,epstein,"Age old tactics, still working on multiple levels."
3013,2,epstein,"I've always felt like Americans have this bad habit of ""picking a side"" and standing by it even when they don't agree with what they're doing or even suffering consequences from it (remember the tea party supporters in Medicaid scooters screaming universal healthcare was just death panels?). It's the worst possible trait and constantly hamstrings real progress. We'd rather our team win than we as a people win. 

Remember kids, loyalty is a poor man's honor!"
3014,2,epstein,Fuck politics
3015,2,epstein,The answer is to hate China together obviously. Haven't you guys been reading?
3016,2,epstein,"Divided and conquered, we are."
3017,2,epstein,"We are brainwashed, but not about Epstein. The media doesn't even talk about Epstein. They fuel the race war. And reddit isn't helping.

This place has become a leftist circle jerk and anyone who even mentions that Republicans aren't all evil gets called a racist. It literally just happened to me in a thread when I mentioned that not every Trump supporter is racist (black people, mexicans, others voted for him too guys). And I don't even like Trump.

You have to be an idiot to not understand that vilifying millions of people based on falsehoods/baseless accusations is a bad idea.

It sucks to see so many Democrats patting themselves on the back and talking shit about Republicans yet so many support people like Hillary and Biden. I thought we were supposed to be the smart ones? Guess everyone is becoming dumb. I'm hoping for some redemption this coming election but I'm not counting on it."
3018,2,epstein,Pretty sure most actual leftists as you put it would condemn Hilary and Biden in the same breath as Trump. The term you want is neoliberals.
3019,2,epstein,I don't know about that. I live in the northeast and am surrounded by plenty of people on the left who wanted Hillary to win and have nothing bad to say about her. That isn't an extremist view from what I've seen. People are very much divided and I see very few democrats talking about how shitty Hillary is.
3020,2,epstein,I didnt really think about it that way but it seems so true
3021,2,epstein,"Because in the US thats what weve been taught as normal, picking a side to be on instead of being unified"
3022,2,epstein,"The erasure of journalism and rise of 24 hour opinion and true propaganda news (ABC video of Kentucky gun range) has made it extremely polarizing bc people want to know whats going on. So they go to what was formerly a fact finding news outlet. 

Now if they do that and talk about something they saw, theyre made fun of and the exact opposite truth can be found elsewhere and displayed to them. 

Rather than those two people agreeing that the media is lying and causing this confusion, they begin arguing and fighting one another. These are normal people who just want to know whats happening. The root cause of all these clashes is the media lying."
3023,2,epstein,"I honestly always heard ""the school's have been taken over by communists"" when I was younger thinking it was a hyperbole or just not true. It holds a lot more merit today and is actually scary."
3024,2,epstein,Imagine being the exact type of person someone is deriding and not getting it. It's you. You're the person we're mocking.
3025,2,epstein,"This is exactly why I hate opening up r/all and repeatedly seeing ""DAE SEE ORANGE MAN BAD?!?"" every god damned day. Has nothing to do with liking Trump (I don't) and everything to do with what a fantastic waste of time it is to repeat the obvious ad nauseam instead of focusing on actual improvements that would help everyone. 

The moment I try to make this argument though I immediately have Democrats down my throat like ""NO U DON'T UNDERSTAND, HE IS A THREAT TO AMERICA"" and it's like dude the exact same was said about Obama. Name one president that magically destroyed the USA in 4 to 8 years. That shit doesn't happen, but USA does stagnate hard as fuck as the wage gap increases significantly because no one's actually doing anything."
3026,2,epstein,I got mass downvoted in /politics earlier for daring to suggest both Obama and trump are bad
3027,2,epstein,"The whole expectation that people have to ""pick a team"" is assinine and puts me off from discussing politics because for the most part there IS no discussion taking place - just echo chambers, and bashing on ""the other team"". 


And I refer to them as teams because people treat it much like they do sports, but *worse*. Far, far worse."
3028,2,epstein,this is why the government and the media are working so hard to keep us divided
3029,2,epstein,"&gt;not brainwashed

&gt;purposefully divided, and is intentional

I'd say that **is** the brainwashing. subtle and unnoticed. a strong nation is one that stands together."
3030,2,epstein,You just admitted the US is brainwashed. The last half is the brainwashed part.
3031,2,epstein,You got me there.
3032,2,epstein,Just so long as youre aware lol.
3033,2,epstein,"if they associate with a party, they are objectively brainwashed...if you see the BS and have no inclination to do anything about it, then you're brainwashed."
3034,2,epstein,"&gt;if you see the BS and have no inclination to do anything about it, then you're brainwashed.

I get so tired of keyboard warriors saying shit like this. What are we supposed to do?

Aside from trying to organize a movement, which would be a full time job and most likely fail, the only thing you can do is be informed, and try to make other people informed.

And, at this point, just informing people on why both political parties are corrupt shills for the wealthy seems like the best course of action."
3035,2,epstein,Stop everything your doing and clog the streets. Cease productivity. Hit them in the money.
3036,2,epstein,"That would entail starting a movement like he said, which is difficult, time consuming, and likely to fail. 

Not that I think youre wrong, I think youre absolutely right actually. But say I were to hit the streets myself and cease productivity, Id simply be fired and replaced. Same if me and my 4 buddies did it. 

How do you get hundreds and thousands of people to do it all simultaneously? And for the same cause? Thats where things get incredibly tricky. 

All honest and open questions, btw. Id love to hear yours and others ideas on the topic."
3037,2,epstein,Cut off internet service and beer flow. People are too comfortable. No matter how bad life gets they can still escape it and ignore it at the end of th day. Take that away and maybe people will actually do something.
3038,2,epstein,No TV and no beer make Americans something something
3039,2,epstein,Go crazy?
3040,2,epstein,DONT MIND IF WE DO!
3041,2,epstein,"not to mention, a collective group of citizens who wanna do shit about it, will naturally start to induce change. resistance and liberty would organically develope if enough people were actually passionate and determined. there isn't a day that passes that i'm not actively pissed off about the illegality of certain drugs,  and actively willing to collaborate with my fellow citizens. the problem is, while they know the drug bans are unjust and immoral, they don't actual care enough to collaborate or do anything about it. it's right in front of our eyes, the blatant tyranny, and no one cares."
3042,2,epstein,"This is the priveleged mindset of someone who hasnt been on the wrong kind of list. Imagine all of your communications being monitored, then spooks going out, either befriending you over a period of time or doing street theatre with the sole aim to antagonize/gaslight you to the point of criminal activity so you're effectively neutralized. 

Tyrrany exists because it works to a much more effective degree than most other systems.  That's why I've given up. Taxation = theft? So what? By that logic, imprisonment = kidnapping. You gonna be the one to stop it?"
3043,2,epstein,"*Eyeroll* Tyranny exists because you would rather live your life a slave and mock those who would stand against it.

It exists because there will always be some selfish fucking idiot who thinks he knows it all and can solve all the worlds Ills. The worst offenders are the ones who believe in their heart of hearts that they and only THEY can save _you_ and they will stop at nothing to save you."
3044,2,epstein,"you should absolutely be doing shit. i'm not a keyboard warrior. i'm an actual warrior. i'm currently working with my local psychedelic society trying to grow the group large enough to make pushes for legalization, but because of people like you who won't join because they are brainwashed into thinking ""it will fail anyway"", it might take a long fuckin time."
3045,2,epstein,"I think that's only a little true. I *can* imagine them out there together.

But look at the things they come out to. Star-powered Trump rallies and Astroturfed Marches. Money and power is what brings Americans out en masse.

I've heard that grassroots is largely a myth in the USA at least. The movements that take root are funded. 

Now if you cut off people's TV and other comforts, they might get agitated enough to at least go outside. That's a start"
3046,2,epstein,"Yep. Cut off the flow of beer, weed and internet and then maybe people will do something. But until then people can't be bothered to do anything because they can just tune out reality and watch tv instead of making a better life for us all."
3047,2,epstein,Right the fuck on!!
3048,2,epstein,Fuck.  This is the real truth right here.  Thanks for putting it so eloquently.

Probably paraphrased"
3052,2,epstein,It's ironic that in many ways conservatives and Democrats both want smaller government. But our mutual goals (maybe not many) are overshadowed by our division on superficial matters compared to the ones that we truly need to unite in.
3053,2,epstein,"&gt; As long as we remain divided, nothing will change.

This has been their goal all along.  While we are fighting each other, our politicians are selling our freedoms to corporations and other countries while billionaires have child sex rings.  These people can do what they want and currently, no one can stop them.  And it's not just in the US, this is a global issue."
3054,2,epstein,"This is one of the most saddest things about such a great nation man, Im an immigrant and I just find this all toxic as fuck, liberals trying to shit on conservatives and conservatives trying to shit on liberals. There is no middle ground, r/politics is living on their own world where every post is confirming their beliefs, and r/The_donald is posting everything that is favorable to Trump.

I have never met anyone that is center, even if there are some, they are a minority. Like there are things I agree from the right, and the things I agree from the left. I cant just vote for one party, sorry for the little rant :/"
3055,2,epstein,"I feel you man. It's depressing when you see both sides just want to hate the other, and never actually discuss anything. And then turn on a dime when their party changes it's position, but degrade the otherside for doing the same."
3056,2,epstein,Protesting in a town of 1000 people has diminishing returns.
3057,2,epstein,"Then again, the second amendment gives us the right to revolt against the government, so it's possible for a madlad to break into the Whitehouse, handcuff everyone there to a desk, and declare themselves Supreme Ruler of America."
3058,2,epstein,"The answer is in your comments. We pretend like if somehow either party won entirely or they both collapsed that would be the end of ""America"" when in truth, it would be the start of new chapter altogether. The two party system has us entrenched in a make-believe game of tug-of-war that only exists as long as we keep pulling either end of the rope. 

The republic isn't at stake; the two party system is. And if it ever shattered, the sun would still be there the next day. A true multi-party system needs to emerge if we ever want to restore Democracy to its true form."

How am I supposed to protest when I live a couple missing paychecks from homelessness?

How am I supposed to tell someone who makes more money than me, that they're not ""middle class"" at all because the whole concept of ""middle class"" is deeply flawed.

How am I supposed to tell someone about an insurmountable problem if there is no viable solution currently in sight?

How am I supposed to tell someone that they're starving if they have a few meals to spare?

How am I supposed to change minds when people would rather rely on emotions and intuition than reality.

How am I supposed to get someone's soul back to the Universe's reality when they live in their own reality?"

3061,2,epstein,Louder for the people in the back

3064,2,epstein,"While I agree with you statement for the most part Id like to interject some semi/kind of optimistic perspective. Half the population has no party that theyre deeply aligned to given the amount of non voters out there.

3067,2,epstein,"There is no Trump cult. Calling his supporters a cult is a propaganda move designed to keep you seeing them as less than people, therefore making it easier for you to justify poor treatment of people who hold slightly different beliefs than you. The nazis did this to Jews in WW2 to justify exterminating the lesser species of Germans.

You are exactly the kind of small minded and easily manipulated person the media hopes its broadcasting to.

You don't see fellow citizens with different view points as citizens with view points, you see them as some vague group you can summarize as a cult, because nobody who doesnt think like you do could possibly be anything but a cult."

a million liberals in California can't just up and go to D.C for protests.

I mean we could get a couple dozen people to show up in the front of our State's Capitol, but that wont make the local news, let alone the national news.

See France and The yellow vests, theyre able to protest in numbers because the country is so much smaller than the US and has better public transportation, connecting people of all ideologies.

I'm actually convinced the US hasn't updated our transportation infrastructure to keep its inhabitants divided in their ""bubbles""."

I have this link bookmarked as ""[Brainwashed Republicans](https://imgur.com/a/YZMyt)"" for a reason. It shows a comparison in opinions on topics between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans swing *wildly* to whatever Trump supports, while Democrats remain mostly stable regardless of who's in office.

Posting is praxis, don't let anyone tell you ""while you're sitting here playing on the internet you could be doing *real* good in the world."" Adding your voice to the crowd saying that some conspiracies are real has a real, if small, positive effect.

The second is to remember to not make things partisan. That's not to say *don't make things political*, because it is political. Don't blame the Republicans, blame the rich, and Capitalism. Don't argue whether it was Trump or the Clintons that killed Epstein, because it was both. They're both part of the same elite, billionaire, neoliberal cabal."

3081,2,epstein,"America is not brainwashed.  Most people feel there is something suspicious about this, but, if you take the ""official story"" Epstein was a coward and killed himself to avoid answering to his accusers, and honestly this would be far from the first time anyone did that.   The more realistic alternate theories point to foul play...with that said, people have gone down the rabit hole to the point of no return and its why we will never have the full truth on this...there are people I have seen on this sub post links to medical reports and autopsy reports that were published by people who are not medical doctors, there are links to investigative reports that were written by people who both are not forensic experts nor were ever anywhere near the scene of the death.  People are open minded to the possibility of foul play, its simply to say that people are brainwashed because people like myself on this sub are quick to question a lot of sources just means we are being critical of where things are coming from giving how easy it is for people to post nonsense on the internet and make it looks like news."

3092,2,epstein,He didnt kill himself
3093,2,epstein,Hes about as dead as you and I. You know hes on an island somewhere. Body double got killed. Or they waited until they found a suitable stiff in the morgue to put in his place. As set up from the word go.
3094,2,epstein,I'm dead inside
3095,2,epstein,"Don't ¶ suicide

Open ¶ inside"
3096,2,epstein,This guy is still alive somewhere. Him with his egg shaped penis.
3097,2,epstein,Fuck him
3098,2,epstein,How do you know its egg shaped? No homo
3099,2,epstein,[Egg shaped Epstein](https://youtu.be/7nyWOzR-1L0)
3100,2,epstein,Omg this is Gold! Thanks for the link. At least something we can laugh at when talking about this monster. His reaction is priceless
3101,2,epstein,Smug fuck
3102,2,epstein,People who say Epstein killed himself because he was depressed that he was in jail are morons. Epstein knew he was legally invincible and fully expected to be released.
3103,2,epstein,"The fucked up part is this ridiculous question was asked so that the deposition was able to be stopped. It's kind of funny, but it's also a tactic that was used so he wouldn't have to testify anymore... that part is extremely un-funny"
3104,2,epstein,"I'm I'll educated about the law but if this is a so called deposition, isn't he supposed to just sit there answer questions? Doesn't a government law person take a deposition? Sorry if i sound retarded."
3105,2,epstein,"If you listen closely, someone (I presume to be Epsteins lawyer or someone overseeing the deposition) says that if they continue to ask questions that are not important, the deposition would be adjourned. Since the guy asked Epstein again it was adjourned."
3106,2,epstein,The ridiculous question was undoubtedly asked with the _intent_ of adjourning the deposition. Another part of the cover-up
3107,2,epstein,Hahaha how's this only have 50 thousand views
3108,2,epstein,Hahahaha I feel like the guy asking the question's voice cracked because he was trying so hard to not laugh.
3109,2,epstein,Soo is it true?
3110,2,epstein,Its also mentioned on The Devil In The Darkness podcast about him iirc. Its a different time hes asked it too
3111,2,epstein,hes still alive
3112,2,epstein,He goes by Miguel Sanchez now. Alert authorities if you see [THIS MAN](https://i.imgur.com/FGFD0LA.png)
3113,2,epstein,Jefe Epstein

3116,2,epstein,It's funny but uncomfortably so
3117,2,epstein,Porn stache
3118,2,epstein,Happy cakeday
3119,2,epstein,"aka ""Dirty"""
3120,2,epstein,"Enjoy those tacos now, for in 1000 years theyll be illegal. Heh heh. I think we all know why"
3121,2,epstein,"I think this is what most reasonable people believe. After all the unreasonable bullshit the govt and media has been attempting to shovel down our throats, the conspiracy theorist are actually correct about this one. There's absolutely no way he's dead. No coroner's report, no body, no surveillance pictures or video, no witnesses. Just a black hole. It's perfectly reasonable to think his buddy Trump or Clinton broke him out and paid for plastic surgery so he can go on abducting children and fucking them under the radar. Pretty fucked up man."
3122,2,epstein,Close but he had/has the money and clout to do it himself but anyway I think he got merc'd by the people with real power. Hollywood is lower on the totem pole.
3123,2,epstein,"They had no reason to kill him other than to shut him up. So to do that instead of killing someone they believed did a good job for them all they had to do was fake his death and whisk him away somewhere and give him a new identity. Where's his degenerate filthy rich whore girlfriend now? Jizzlaine Maxwell? No one even wants to question her? LOL Btw, notice the American flag military patch on his shirt."
3124,2,epstein,"Its way fucking easier, cheaper, and less messy to kill someone than it is to give them a whole new life."
3125,2,epstein,"Theyre billionaires man, itd be cheaper for you but these people can literally buy countries."
3126,2,epstein,They run countries
3127,2,epstein,But then you need to hire yet another guy to host your pedo island
3128,2,epstein,ding ding ding
3129,2,epstein,"Way too big of a risk to kill him.

If he has a ""deadmans switch"" in place, which someone in his position would be a fool not to, the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.

Way smarter to just whisk him away and keep him quiet."
3130,2,epstein,"just wondering, and i'm not condoning anything, but was he a pedophile in the sense of having sex with physically developed 16 and 17 year old women, or actual children? i think that this is an important distinction.


why am i being downvoted? 7 year olds would be much worse than 17 year olds...i'm not defending him you fuckers...i'm just not familiar with the case and genuinly curious.

**i got sidetracked into a debate over the age of consent and the difference between a 17 year old and a 7 year old and then people starting calling me a dangerous rapist apologist in spite of never actually making any claim to support any form of rape or violence...its as if they really want people to be bad and dangerous so that they have an opportunity to demonstrate their moral superiority..."
3131,2,epstein,He trafficked girls from Eastern Europe into sexual slavery. Does it really make any difference if they were 7 or 17? He's a fucking monster.
3132,2,epstein,Pretty sure the girls were like 12/13 when hed start them so thats definitely not sexually developed
3133,2,epstein,yeah i think it makes a difference. 7 is worse than 17.
3134,2,epstein,"IIRC he did traffick girls at least as young as 8, as well as young teens."
3135,2,epstein,11-12 year old girls were reported.
3136,2,epstein,It wasnt just 17 year old but girls from 8-17.
3137,2,epstein,"While I appreciate the difference between raping a 7 and 17 year old, I disagree that it makes a difference when either one is trafficked and likely drugged and primed for a while before being used as a sex toy. It's terrible to do to someone at any age. At that point it becomes more about the sheer magnitude of how corrupt and powerful he is. But I believe he is technically an ephebophile. I've heard reports as young as 13, which would be hebephilia range, but more often it seems to be 15-18 year olds."
3138,2,epstein,Look up post Dorian little st James done 8/30/19 on YouTube. At 2:10 you can see what looks like Epstein talking to one of the workers.
3139,2,epstein,Nah he's dead. He was off'ed by those in real power. He didn't kill himself for sure but it was a hit.
3140,2,epstein,"Yeah a guy like this has got to have a deadmans switch,,, they wouldnt allow that blackmail to get out there so they rescued him."
3141,2,epstein,"Besides the pedo stuff he moved around a lot of $$$ for various people. He was a money launderer. He had more damaging info on the international elite and intel agencies than Wikileaks. They need to make a movie about this piece of shit. But yeah, they'll chicken out and show him dead, they'll never show the faked death. Maybe someone should talk to Tarantino about this, he might be able to get away with doing an ending with Epstein alive."
3142,2,epstein,I think so too.
3143,2,epstein,I don't think he is tbh. You keep your assets around and you get rid of your liabilities. I just don't see him as an asset.
3144,2,epstein,Unless he had a dead mans switch
3145,2,epstein,"If he is, he's had some major plastic surgery and serves the Jewish mafia (aka that part of the mossad) and JINOs like Weinstein in some other capacity."
3146,2,epstein,"&gt; On Tuesday [**the New York Times reported**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-jail-officers.html) that guards in the Special Housing Unit had allegedly fallen asleep on the night of Epstein's death. 

you know what's hilarious about this? I've worked a good amount of night shift jobs in my adult life. most of my jobs have been night shift.. you don't fall asleep because it's night. you acclimate really easy to a night shift job. it's like its just simple enough for a normie to understand... oh it happened at night so the night shift guards fell asleep because it was night... that's such horseshit... there were two guards, they wouldn't have fallen asleep together at any rate.. if it were some sort of situation where someone magically fell asleep they wouldn't have both fallen asleep. two nightshift guards in the same section of the jail fell asleep, and it just so happened to be the same night epstein decided to kill himself...  

also of course the fact he was found on the ground.. but night shift people aren't dosing off every night like in the cartoons"
3147,2,epstein,"To clarify, he wasn't on suicide watch at the time of death"
3148,2,epstein,"Thank you... Who's spreading misinformation? If you're trying to keep his story relevant, don't make up thing. To me, it's more important to know he was taken off watch shortly after he attempted suicide."
3149,2,epstein,"Yes.

I mean, he should have been, and considering that he just had been a week ago, they should have been observing him religiously considering the things he knew, but we can't let falsehoods keep floating out there because people use it to attack the actual story, which is already egregious."
3150,2,epstein,"To further clarify, his own lawyers claimed that his cellmate attacked him, which, they claimed, is how he got his injuries, and why he should be taken off of suicide watch.

His own lawyers took him off suicide watch.

He committed suicide after moving all his assets to a foundation in a foreign country.

Episode, Alone in a Cell
https://wondery.com/shows/the-mysterious-mr-epstein/"
3151,2,epstein,"#Not on suicide watch. 

Epstein's lawyer argued that he was attacked by his cell mate, [Nicholas Tartaglione](https://nypost.com/2019/09/23/ex-cop-accused-of-hurting-jeffrey-epstein-killed-a-guy-with-zip-ties-feds/),  a former New York police officer who was arrested in December 2016 on charges of killing four men in a cocaine distribution conspiracy, was sharing a cell with Epstein in Manhattans Metropolitan Correctional Center at the time Epstein was found semiconscious in the fetal position with marks on his neck.  

#[Jeffery Epstein's former cellmate Nicholas Tartaglione requests move from MCC, alleging threats from prison guards](https://6abc.com/epsteins-former-cellmate-alleges-threats-from-prison-guards/5481525/)  (August 21, 2019)   
&gt;In a letter to the court, Tartaglione's attorney alleged that correction officers know his client has information ""potentially very damaging"" to the staff at MCC. 

&gt;He wrote that guards at the facility have told him to ""shut up,"" ""stop talking"" and ""stop complaining.""
-
&gt;""The clear message Mr. Tartaglione has received is that if he conveys information about the facility or about the recent suicide, there will be a price to pay,"" his attorney, Bruce Barket, wrote the judge. ""The continuing and seemingly unresolvable problems with the conditions of Mr. Tartaglione's confinement coupled with the unfortunate attempted suicide by a cellmate, to which Mr. Tartaglione is a critical witness, and the successful suicide of that same person makes his continued detention at the MCC inappropriate.""  

&amp;nbsp;

~~***Three can keep a secret if two are dead***~~ ***Dead men tell no tales.***

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: a more appropriate ending quote."
3152,2,epstein,"Epstein didn't kill himself.  He's still alive.  There were reports of unregistered transport vans coming in and out of the prison around the time of his ""death,"" and the body that was taken from his cell was said to not even be him.  The man who did Epstein's autopsy was the same who did JFK and MLK.  This is a coverup.  Epstein was broken out of prison and is still alive."
3153,2,epstein,That fella must be over 100 years old by now
3154,2,epstein,"Michael Baden [DID NOT](https://apnews.com/afs:Content:6878060213) preform Epsteins autopsy. His lawyers requested him, but the autopsy was preformed by Dr. Barbara Sampson instead. Baden was there only to observe.

Edit: Also, after [observing](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2019/10/30/famed-pathologist-michael-baden-says-jeffrey-epsteins-death-was-homicide/amp/) the autopsy, Dr. Baden insisted that the death seemed more like a homicide than a suicide... so.."
3155,2,epstein,Ayyyy /r/conspiracy reaching the front page with 94%?  Nice.
3156,2,epstein,"Nah hes dead man, hes the scape goat. The OTHER billionaires hes protecting with his death walk free now. There is no fucking way hes alive when him being dead means the OTHER billionaires wont be accused moving forward. Their slates have been wiped clean and unless theres damning evidence directly to them individually nothing will happen to them. Hes dead. Hes a liability alive."
3157,2,epstein,This.  They killed him to keep themselves safe.
3158,2,epstein,"He wouldn't have gotten on the plane from Europe to the US. He knew he was going to be arrested the second he set foot in the US but he did it anyway. 

It's all a play. A show performance. The whole Epstein story arc, from start to finish.

This means the goal is to piss everyone off and convince them there is no accountability or justice, to make unrest more likely. I'm becoming convinced this is being done intentionally to provoke unrest."
3159,2,epstein,"I'm convinced this is being done intentionally to provoke unrest.

By who, and why?"
3160,2,epstein,"Maybe Soros, to buy gov't bonds cheaply and then resell them later, or gain a majority share and take over the government, like he has done many times before to many other countries?"
3161,2,epstein,Why? Because it sounds like an evil plot? It is better for the visitors to his island that he is dead. Unless you feel they kept him alive because they will accept him and only him to supply children???
3162,2,epstein,Whoever he had blackmail on didnt kill him. Whoever he was keeping blackmail for killed him. Any information he was keeping automatically becomes worthless as leverage if it gets out. You cant control anyone with it if they get ruined. This is whoever was handling Epstein protecting their investment.
3163,2,epstein,Don't forget AG William Barr was in charge of his security
3164,2,epstein,"Barr's law firm *defended* him in Florida, and Acosta prosecuted. Both appointed by Trump. Barr recused himself then later recanted under Trump's direction. Two days after Trump defended Acosta he resigned.

The timing of the arrest, the players involved and the damning evidence we'll never see now because he's supposedly dead could very well be used to shield the president (and his allies) against any meaningful investigation. Epstein's powerful clients now belong to Trump and his cronies, else be outed."
3165,2,epstein,"Epstein was a spook rubbing a deep state money laundering, sex trafficking, and blackmail op. Barr is a covert CIA asset who specializes in legal coverups like Iran-Contra and BCCI.

3166,2,epstein,"Wishful thinking, but if a Dem gets the presidency next election and installs a new AG after Barr, maybe more info will come to light. Again, wishful thinking."
3167,2,epstein,Both of them were involved. Both of them were bad. Nobody's defending Clinton here mate
3168,2,epstein,"The dudes name is freedomstorch, hes a brainwashed trump drone."
3169,2,epstein,"This whole thing is starting to feel like it's designed to somehow focus everyone away from the current administration's troubles and back onto their very favorite boogeyman The Clintons.

Like, They are dirty as fuck, and Epstein's death (or not) is shady as hell, but somehow the narrative seems to be ""Bill Clinton Personally Murdered Jeffery Epstein and every single thing that has happened in the world since is just a smokescreen to protect Bill Clinton"""
3170,2,epstein,Because a bullshit narrative that might satisfy ones sense of the unknown is better than a senseless world where the truth is guarded and we are (at the moment) powerless in seeing.
3171,2,epstein,"Sure, but the fact that the Narrative emerging around Epstein seems to be laser focused on deflecting attention from anything except Bill Clinton seems pretty wild, when guys like Barr are up to their necks in it and *ran the prison system* when it happened.

But No, Bill Clinton (who all leftists are secretly in love with even if they won't admit it) personally broke in and killed him, and any attempt to look at anyone else is ""just a distraction"".

Starting to feel like THIS is becoming the distraction."
3172,2,epstein,"Look I just gotta say it. I used to work in a state prison. Not gonna name it. ""Alcatraz of the South"" I worked suicide watch before. Theres one way in and one way out. If anything happened, more than 1 person had to go along with it. Its frustrating knowing this scenario is impossible. Period. It would not happen, where I worked anyway. Perspective from a former member of the corrections union. Noped out of there as soon as I saw the bigger picture."
3173,2,epstein,"Pretty sure hes still alive. Wasnt it on 4chan or somewhere, a picture of someone whos clearly him? Regardless if a photo exists though hes definitely not dead."

Plus, if you were trying to lay low after faking your death, why would you go to the most obvious place for you to be?

I could believe Epstein is still alive, but this photo can't be positively ID'd as him."

3185,2,epstein,thirded
3186,2,epstein,"Also, 4chan broke the story. They were the first report by almost half an hour."
3187,2,epstein,"My hot take

The CIA has been using Epstein to get blackmail for a long time. Trump came in and decided to stop the program. None of it can ever come to light however, because it would damage the US and allies too badly. So Epstein had to die, and the upper levels of our government know."
3188,2,epstein,"This should still be story of the century so far, and the complete silence from the media should be enough evidence by itself for even people who don't follow conspiracies that mainstream news is as real as chinese state news."

3196,2,epstein,"Im not even a conspiracy theorist (so maybe I shouldnt be posting around here), but to me this is hardly even conspiracy. Its so fucking obvious that this is all wrong.

3198,2,epstein,"1) Those responsible are free.

2) Those responsible knew it would look highly suspicious, nonetheless *for reasons known only to them* they determined that the trouble of suspicion was worth avoiding charges coming to light.  To put another way, what they're hiding is bad enough to go sloppy with his assassination.  They needed him dead ASAP, not a moment later."
3199,2,epstein,Epstein is alive. Thanks for believing what the pedophiles want you to believe.
3200,2,epstein,its truly not the point
3201,2,epstein,"What?  Why would you think that?  If Epstein were alive he'd be a *huge* liability to those he found kids for.  You seem to believe in a massive conspiracy of powerful evil people who can do whatever they want, but don't think they'd kill Epstein in a heartbeat to keep their hold on power?  That's weird."

The guy had his finger in so many pies it didn't matter what country, political spectrum, gender, age, race or job you had. Literally every person that guy met had enough power and influence to have this done without ever being found out.

Terrifying really."
3210,2,epstein,"The girl in the back, way back, whats going on with her hand?"
3211,2,epstein,He didnt kill himself. He was silenced.

go try and drown yourself.   You cant.  your brain will not allow you to if there is a way out, and he would have simply had to get up off his knees, or pull himself up to prevent it - he was strangled to death by the giant 4 time murdering ex cop they made his cell mate - something that doesn't happen when you're such a high profile prisoner, you get kept in solitary or in your own cell.  


this dude was murdered so people like the royal family, the Clintons, and trump could keep him from squacking in court and blowing the lid on all the fucked up bullshit that the elites of this country and many others have been doing.

3247,2,epstein,Put the cheetos down and hit the streets.
3248,2,epstein,Also dont forget hes more than likely alive and well continuing his business
3249,2,epstein,We just happened to be asleep while the cameras were not working as well etc. What a fucking coinky dink.
3250,2,epstein,I wonder how these guys are communicating.  I wonder if he was aware of something more advanced..
3251,2,epstein,"Does the secret service protect all embassies?

Edit, yes they do... TIL"
3252,2,epstein,This is what the media should be focused on... we need the truth
3253,2,epstein,"Justice, one of the many words that doesn't exist in elites world."
3254,2,epstein,how was this already 80 days ago. wtf?
3255,2,epstein,Epstein is not dead. Why would the elite kill a friend they've had for decades? Think Epstein would sell out his elite friends? He knows the consequences they bailed him out.
3256,2,epstein,I dont think anyone here knows how violent prisons can be they are rural and injured must be airlifted so the guards come from all black or all white hillbillies who never encounter other races and prison is a private industry not a federal institution if you go to prison in Florida they torture you and you will see people murdered gurenteed.. to survive in Florida prison u gotta be willing to kill they kill people for ramen noodles and torture for fun same with the guards they even allow inmates to fight or leave inmates alone while they smoke. We call our prisons gladiator school and there is no protective custody so if locked up here he would still be dead... so no matter what someone was gonna kill him and torture him. I believe he is dead so there wont be a trial exposing others cuz he would take a plea being a spoiled brat and rat on all of them he was like JFK a threat to the elite members of society. Dont forget this is and never was a democracy.
3257,2,epstein,Ever since someone pointed out that he never shows his teeth I really notice it now. There's one pic with his teeth and they look tiny and like there's too many in his mouth.
3258,2,epstein,"He is living in South America somewhere - there is no evidence he is dead. Conveniently missing surveillance video, less than believable coroners report, inexcusable lack of procedures in the prison that would never have happened in real life.  There is no way he is dead."
3259,2,epstein,"&gt; every elite member

 elite member of what?"
3260,2,epstein,"&gt;In political and sociological theory, the elite (French Èlite, from Latin eligere) are a small group of powerful people who hold a disproportionate amount of wealth, privilege, political power, or skill in a society.

Sorry the public school system failed you :["
3261,2,epstein,"Who?

Jk, it's fucked up for sure. A true conspiracy for once."
3262,2,epstein,"unpopular opinion, child rapists and child abusers are often beat up and or killed in prison, and his cellmate was a massive man capable of killing him.  guards also like to take off when assholes are getting beaten"
3263,2,epstein,"NEWSFLASH!

I WORK AT A PRISON AND IF THIS GUY CAME IN, NO WAY ANY OTHER INMATE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HIM!! HE WOULD BE SINGLED CELLED LOCKED UP WITH A GUARD AND A MONITOR ON 24/7 WITH LIMITED PEOPLE KNOWING!

SORRY BUT THEY KILLED HIM OR FAKED HIS DEATH AND HE ESCAPED THE FIRST TIME THE PARAMEDICS WERE CALLED ON THE FAILED SUICIDE ATTEMPT"
3264,2,epstein,"Tbh in my exp its all pretty legit. He was taken off constant watch by the psych. He was on a segregated housing unit which usually requires 15 min checks however on 3rd shift Ive never seen anyone make every check. One guard was a old head on OT and the other was a Rookie. With 100s of cameras operating in a single facility its likely there are a few that dont work and they wont be fixed until something like this happens no matter how many times you write the work order. And as far as limited people knowing hes there? Lmfao everyone and their mother would know. Prisons are like highschools man. The rumor mill starts churning and everyone knows everything in minutes and none of it is true lmao 
Did they lock up a body double originally and then he killed himself? Plausible. 
Did a whole prison conspire to kill or allow a billionaire to escape or get switched with a double after locked up and nobody leaked it? Na bro ,I aint buying that and if you worked in a prison you wouldnt either man. Too many moving parts. 
But what do I know ,Im just a dumb jail guard. Stay safe homie."
3265,2,epstein,I log in the suicide watch logs that all medical RN check 10mins around the clock plus video recording. Had to be inside job where everyone turned a blind eye. No way that someone on suicide watch killed themselves. I am not naive suicides do happen but Epstein would be of max security and be watched like a hawk no one  would be close to him and the only way he would be hurt is the guards let it happen. Plain and simple! Epstein of all people wouldnt be treated normally at all come on!
3266,2,epstein,"If you stop and give it some thought, youll arrive at the worrying conclusion that this opinion youve just put forth was formed with the disparate bits of disinfo that has been released around the Epstein story: ie youve fallen for the propaganda.

There is no evidence to prove Epstein was ever even in the prison, let alone him being dead. Just assumptions borne of unprovable vagueries uttered by the complicit for the masses to drool over."
3267,2,epstein,Never forget https://imgur.com/gallery/5QaiXs3
3268,2,epstein,And those responsible would probably get killed by others if it became necessary. Hitmen are expendable. Their bosses walk around untouched until they finally become a problem to others of their kind.
3269,2,epstein,upsidedown evil System! Fuck all of them!
3270,2,epstein,I can't believe it's been that long already. The average person 100% has forgotten. The government successfully and quickly made sure of that with all manner of distractions.
3271,2,epstein,"[Reminder that certain subs treat this as ""spreading false information](https://i.imgur.com/gxQ7JYp.png)"
3272,2,epstein,"honestly, good. memes of this shit suck, and it makes it less serious."

3282,2,epstein,Epstein did not kill himself. Dont believe fake news no matter where it comes from. Its the only way to get the cabal to stop trying to kill someone they already think is dead.
3283,2,epstein,Nothing but a civil war can stop these people. How can a bunch of average people take down the richest and most powerful without violence? Who ever gets their flashlight close will get whacked and when one gets exposed they'll just be taken out like Epstein..

Our most trusted source of information, and some of you dont trust them? I mean, theyre on the cutting edge front line, giving us the facts all the time. They were under attack leading into the gulf war. They knew within seconds that it was Osama Bin Laden that caused the crashes on 9/11. They gave us non-stop coverage of the horrible Jussie Smollett hate crime. Dont you think if there was more of a story surrounding Epstein, our trusted media would tell us about it? They know we LOVE the news and a good story."

3306,2,pockets,"Cart before the horse on that one. Women's clothing doesn't have pockets because they have purses. Pockets are ugly, and carrying things in them ruins lines and creates bulky areas. Basically, since women have a ubiquitous and socially acceptable option, it's better to keep their clothes without such aesthetically displeasing additions."
3307,2,pockets,Thank you for articulating that. Very valid point.
3308,2,pockets,They could have 800 pockets. Women are still buying purses.
3309,2,pockets,I would like to see pants with 800 pockets
3310,2,pockets,"I would wear them, and I would expect them to be really cool or just made stupid, there will be no inbetween"
3311,2,pockets,"I know this is tongue in cheek but you've got it backwards, because women carry purses there is no demand for pockets on their pants. Also they may not want to carry objects in pockets because it would break up curves or lines."

3328,2,pockets,"This makes sense considering how pants usually fit on a woman. To play devils advocate tho, Ive gone through plenty emo years and wore tight jeans with sufficient pockets. However it still might come down to the difference in fit between men and women"
3329,2,pockets,"I feel like this makes sense, somehow"
3330,2,pockets,"It might make more sense if the companies that made pants also made purses.  I suppose Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Hermes and others might make pants, but it's not their main gig."

Illuminati confirmed. 

We are all so screwed."
3337,2,pockets,They dont need pocket as almost all women carry purses to begin with. Within purses you normally find a clutch or pocketbook they keep monetary things in that would normally go in a pocket like a male. Dumb.
3338,2,pockets,Did you hear this one on German Jodel?
3339,2,pockets,"Or in my case, so their bf has to carry all their shit."
3340,2,pockets,There is no way I can carry all the shit I need in my pockets anyway.
3341,2,pockets,"I don't consider the pockets in my jeans small....and I seldom carry a purse...only cuz I need a new one. 

Pockets in dress clothes like slacks definitely small or non existent pockets...so glad I seldom have a need to dress up. Give me blue jeans and a tee shirt/hoodie any day."
3342,2,pockets,"Even if women's pockets were as large as mens pockets, women still wouldnt be able to fit all they shit they carry in a purse in said pockets.  Even if they could, women would look all lumpy because they have 20lbs of random shit crammed in their pockets.  Best to just let em carry around an overpriced satchel and call it a day."
3343,2,pockets,My mom agrees on this one.
3344,2,pockets,"lol I raise you this: Women's pants have little to no pockets so that they have to have purses, which feminizes the act of carrying a bag as a man. This forces us to carry it all in our pockets like men.. allowing this wallet to fuck our backs up, and this phone to zap our balls."
3345,2,pockets,"I thought it was because they have natural pockets...

3346,2,pockets,I believe this and think this needs to change. Womens pants need pockets too.
3347,2,pockets,"Lol I tell my wife this all the time. If you make 100 million women spend $25 dollars on a handbag, that's 2.5 billion. What if they spend $100 or $1000 on handbags..."
3348,2,pockets,It makes them look more sexually desirable so its a trade off maybe the men will be compelled to buy them the purse.
3349,2,pockets,women's pants usually are made without pockets because it adds volume on the hips. Also in women's jeans you can notice that the back pockets are smaller to make the illusion of a rounder/bigger butt.
3350,2,pockets,"I buy jeans with bigger pockets that are closer together to make my hind end appear smaller...not that it's anyone's bizz.

May we never go back to mom jeans...which did have smaller pockets spread 10 ft apart."

When you can make what you need, you don't need to rely on others as much."
3358,2,pockets,Do you know how expensive fabric and patterns are now? Its crazy. Its definitely not financially worth it to make your own clothes.
3359,2,pockets,Is it more expensive than buying pants with bigger pockets?
3360,2,pockets,"Compared to designer jeans? No, its not more expensive. But after you buy a pattern and fabric itll run you around $120. And thats if you get a lower quality fabric. Also, that price assumes you already have a sewing machine, needle, and thread that can handle denim (its heavier than cotton and requires some amount of specialty tools)."
3361,2,tenYr,"Anyone who did the 10 year challenge already probably posts plenty of pictures on Facebook, they have so much data to go by already."

The nsa is obviously always recording us but they dont have the man power to sit and watch everything from everyone 24/7.

Today on Reddit's home page one of the recommended subreddits is a dirt bike subreddit."
3413,2,tenYr,Could also be targeted based on what your neighbors and surrounding area are looking into.
3414,2,tenYr,I've lived here for 6 years without ever seeing it. But you're right in that it could just be targeted because the interest in dirt bikes in this area increased with the new neighbors
3415,2,tenYr,I had a targeted advertising experience yesterday that for the life of me I cant explain with any logical reason except a massive coincidence
3416,2,tenYr,The targeted ad experiences I hate the most are when watching TV on demand and some random advertiser freaking well addresses you by your actual name.  That really gives me the creeps.

3418,2,tenYr,"My local TV on demand in New Zealand.  Has happened with two separate advertisers now. I asked about it in a local group, and quite a few others had had the same experience.  Totally thought I'd lost the plot the first time it happened.  But yeah, creepily creepy."

3421,2,tenYr,"Counterpoint: there's dozens, potentially hundreds or thousands, of people who got the same recommendation and never saw a dirtbike this week. Coincidences do happen."
3422,2,tenYr,You're not wrong. It very well could be a coincidence. People tend to notice patterns even when there isn't one. I just don't trust phones to NOT be listening
3423,2,tenYr,"I'm not really sure how you would identify dirtbikes specifically through a cellphone microphone; seems like you'd be just as likely to get lawnmowers or motorcycles suggested. Then I'm not sure how the data would make it to Reddit, given you'd probably need lower-level access to the hardware than most apps would get.

Never say never, but I don't think they're listening that closely: if they were, then criminal trials would be a lot faster, seeing as we're all walking around with wiretaps. Even if you argue that the data couldn't be used that way, as it would expose the existence of an intelligence program, it doesn't really explain how such privileged information reaches marketers.

Just seems like a lot of gaps to cross. More likely, there are fewer unique conversations going on than we believe, and enough data leaks through social media that you can actually predict what people discuss.

Though, that still doesn't explain your dirtbikes, which I'm just putting up to coincidence: I tried to figure out if there would be some reason that sub would be promoted, such as a major dirtbiking event, and I didn't find anything. Maybe there's a viral video out there we aren't aware of."
3424,2,tenYr,"I really do appreciate that you looked into a reasonable answer for something weird. It's a breath of fresh air, hah. It very likely is a crazy coincidence.

More than once Ive bought something, never once said it out loud for my phone to hear, and come home and quickly see Facebook ads for the thing I just bought but never see ads for previously. Which if true, is sort of silly because you already bought it."
3426,2,tenYr,Elaborate?
3427,2,tenYr,"""Ok google, order pizza""

And magically your phone reacts...

It's always tuned in."
3428,2,tenYr,The shit thats nefarious to me is when they slip a hey Alexa or an  Ok Google commercial on tv when youre not paying attention.
3429,2,tenYr,'magically'
3430,2,tenYr,i did that and nothing happened
3431,2,tenYr,Is google selling brands of tv though? Im wondering what you meant by even tv remotes
3432,2,tenYr,"""smart"" appliances that are connected to the internet. I personally have zero and never will other than  my PC, phone and game systems"
3433,2,tenYr,Yeah my remote just has 2 AAA batteries and you have to hold the microphone button to use it. If it's always recording and uploading to the TV wouldn't it die rather quickly?
3434,2,tenYr,"I was making the comment with smartphone/tablets/speakers in mind.  
If with your tv voice is transmitted through the remote that would probably not the case."
3435,2,tenYr,Smart tvs run on android.
3436,2,tenYr,"I still have a 15 year old plasma TV. The picture now has burn in problems,  but I'll be damned if I'm buying a ""smart"" TV. Btw, you CANNOT find a dumb TV."
3437,2,tenYr,Buy a TV second hand so it isn't linked to you via paperwork. Do not give it WiFi Pass /connect Ethernet. This is your only solution.
3438,2,tenYr,"If I'm forced to buy a TV soon, I'll do my best to disable its ability to connect to the internet. Something tells me that most of the TV won't function like this, but I hope I'm wrong."
3439,2,tenYr,"Yeah, maybe. Everything is becoming more online these days. You got games that only work when connected to internet (Offline singleplayer games). You got the ""Internet of things"" with the 5G coming over the horizon. Expect your toaster to talk to your speakers and so on in the future. 

 I have my TV connected to my PC. Just switch display and I have internet."
3440,2,tenYr,Lol forced. Someone gonna come in and put a gun to your head bro?
3441,2,tenYr,Firewall is useful these days..
3442,2,tenYr,You know you could not connect it to the internet right?
3443,2,tenYr,Or I could take measures to minimize tracking.
3444,2,tenYr,"Yeah, like not connecting it to the internet?"
3445,2,tenYr,I have the TV connected to my PC via HDMI. Don't need to give the TV my internet this way and I have access to a lot more (Like PC gaming if I want).
3446,2,tenYr,Hdmi with ethernet?
3447,2,tenYr,"Not all HDMI cables are the same, and some can't do that."
3448,2,tenYr,Not how it works
3449,2,tenYr,"Well, I could connect to the internet with privacy measures like a VPN and use private browsing techniques. Or I could do it the absolutely dumbest way possible like you suggest."
3450,2,tenYr,"&gt; If I'm forced to buy a TV soon, I'll do my best to disable its ability to connect to the internet. 

Its ironic that you call his suggestion to not connect to the internet dumb when this is literally you in another comment."
3451,2,tenYr,Lol!
3452,2,tenYr,"It seems to me that VPNs would be ran by Intelligence agencies (Five Eyes *et al.*) business fronts. They have your incoming traffic and credit card information. Tor was created and is controlled by [the **Office of Naval Research (ONR)**, an organization within the United States Department of the Navy, and DARPA], so every node, every relay, every entrance and exit node on this network [is controlled by them] & Not to mention that every other law enforcement agency (Federal, state, and local) now have their eyes on incoming and outgoing traffic of known Tor nodes (see: https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-183a).

Edit: Changes in brackets."
3453,2,tenYr,"I mean, you are the one afraid of getting a smart TV do whatever works for you lmao"
3454,2,tenYr,It's not fear. It's none of anyone's business. You want my info? You're not getting it for free.
3455,2,tenYr,"Ok cool, that's why I suggest not connecting the smart TV to the internet.

I just want you to upgrade from your shitty plasma dawg, TVs are way better now lol"
3456,2,tenYr,What if you just want to watch movies from your nas or other network appliance?
3457,2,tenYr,Why use a vpn? That just tunnels all your traffic to one company rofl
3458,2,tenYr,Covering the camera and blocking any WAN access of the TV in the router unless you need a firmware update sounds like a reasonable compromise to me.
3459,2,tenYr,"The CIA exploited Samsungs smart TVs in a joint project with MI5 from 2013-2015. Its anybodys guess just how far this went, even after the Vault-7 leak."
3460,2,tenYr,"Youre right to be suspect of so called Smart TVs. The CIA and MI5 hacked Samsung smart TVs in 2013. Heres the *Wikileaks.org* [press release and analysis](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/index.html) of the CIA Vault-7 hacking tools, in addition to the [Weeping Angel (Extending) Engineering Notes](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_12353643.html) to read at your leisure. 

Excerpt taken from Sean Hollisters article published on [*www.CNET.com*](https://www.cnet.com/news/weeping-angel-hack-samsung-smart-tv-cia-wikileaks/) on 8 March 2017:

&gt;	In 2014, the CIA and UK's MI5 held a joint workshop to improve the ""Weeping Angel"" hack, which appears to have specifically targeted Samsung's F8000 series TVs released in 2013.

&gt;	A ""Fake-Off"" mode was developed to trick users into thinking their TV was off (by turning off the screen and front LEDs), while still recording voice conversations. Based on what we know about the TV, the hack would have tapped into the microphone located in a TV's accompanying remote.

&gt;	The good news is that as of June 2014, the TVs couldn't be hacked remotely, over the internet. The group was installing the hack by physically plugging a USB cable (or thumb drive, we're not sure which) into the TV. In addition:

&gt;- The hack only worked on certain firmware versions of the same TV. It was successfully tested on TVs running firmware versions 1111, 1112, and 1116, but there wasn't yet a way to hack version 1118 and newer.
-	They had not yet figured out a way to turn off the blue LED on the back of the TV, or show the traditional Samsung logos -- which might tip off a user who tried to ""turn the TV back on.""
-	The TV's Wi-Fi connection couldn't be forced to remain on when the screen was off -- which meant the TV would either have to be physically plugged into the network, or else the CIA would have to wait for the TV to be on before transmitting a recorded conversation.
-	The CIA was working on a way to keep the TV from automatically updating itself -- and thus patching the vulnerability -- but hadn't yet implemented it.
-	They couldn't yet eavesdrop in real time, or take screenshots of what a user was looking at on the TV, but they were planning both of those features.

&gt;	In 2015, Samsung caught flak when it was revealed that some of their Smart TVs listened to your conversations. Back then, we described a way to turn that feature off.

&gt;##What we dont know

&gt;	Literally anything that might have happened with Weeping Angel after 2014. We dont know...

&gt;-	If the CIA and MI5 decided to target newer Samsung TVs as well, or TVs from other brands.
-	If they found ways to hack TVs over the internet and keep them hacked indefinitely.
-	If they found workarounds for newer firmware versions.
-	If they have other capabilities.
-	If the CIA or MI5 ever actually used the hack to spy on people.
-	If Samsung might have patched the original vulnerabilities entirely by now.
-	If the CIA gave up entirely on the project after June 2014.
-	If turning off your Samsungs voice-recognition feature or its Wi-Fi connection would do anything to stop the hack (though it probably cant hurt).

&gt;Assuming the documents are legit, we only have a nearly three-year-old snapshot of what two spy agencies were doing to a single range of TVs, back in the day."
3461,2,tenYr,Second hand?
3462,2,tenYr,You cna hack these TVs and do whatever you want. Android TVs have no lock down. Just don't connect to the internet too if you're worried.
3463,2,tenYr,"Because there are so few people resistant to progression and change that it's not worth producing ""dumb"" TVs. Also this post sounds so much like, ""Old man too stubborn to change."" I can get not wanting a smart phone that tracks your contacts or location or browsing data to try and sell you stuff, but I don't get why someone would bother caring or being protective about what they watch on Netflix or cable television."
3464,2,tenYr,Next phone I get will be de-Googled.
3465,2,tenYr,Might I suggest a jitterbug
3466,2,tenYr,"My issue is that streaming boxes are always better than smart TV's. The TVs are slow, run old software in many cases, or just don't have the horsepower to play whatever high-bitrate rip I'm streaming. I'd rather get a dumb TV and hook up a Roku or Apple TV. As it stands I have a smart TV with everything disconnected and I just use Apple TV for 'smart' stuff. Seems pointless to have a smart TV.

For example If I'm paying 1500 for a TV and 500 for a streaming box... well I doubt they've put a third of the TV's value into the dinky little onboard computer, so the external box is gonna be better."
3467,2,tenYr,"That's fair, I use my xbox for most streaming services but my tv in my office room having internet capability is pretty convenient and I don't notice a huge dip in quality. Anecdotal, of course so not to invalidate that ymmv."
3468,2,tenYr,"Once you're up and running it's fine I just find all the smart TVs way slower to navigate than the dedicated boxes. They're kinda sluggish. Since the AppleTV is a bit locked down and I don't want to mess with network streaming I do use the smart TV function on my current TV to play files off of a hard drive, like old shows and rips and things. It's very sluggish to navigate and it can't handle blu-ray bitrates or anything close really. 

I just wish they committed either to making the internal ones a little better or just committed to telling people to pick their own box separate from the TVs."
3469,2,tenYr,"That's why periodically just take pictures on my balls and my gooch..

For the man.

Spy on deez nuts Big Bro"
3470,2,tenYr,Taint shots keep my FBI agent happy.
3471,2,tenYr,yup. they are literally feeding the 5g IoT AI facial recognition/control system that will be turned on soon
3472,2,tenYr,"Dude i walked in the house the other day, and my playstation came off idle mode. Did the fucking controller hear me? I think it did, because there's a menu somewhere for saying something like 'okay playstation' and using voice commands."
3473,2,tenYr,But you need a microphone for that
3474,2,tenYr,Ps5 controllers have mics if that's what he has
3475,2,tenYr,Do i? I thought there were some games where you could talk into the controller. That it was a two-way speaker thing?
3476,2,tenYr,"Not unless you're talking about PS5, which you may be. If it's 4 though the controller doesn't have a mic"
3477,2,tenYr,Maybe i left my headset plugged in and i forgot then. Ps4.
3478,2,tenYr,"Im not watching anymore! Didnt really anyways, scary"
3479,2,tenYr,And as of yesterday my mattress is even watching me.
3480,2,tenYr,I dont have a TV remote. Maybe the inconvenience of having to get up to adjust the volume is paying off!
3481,2,tenYr,Watching me? Mine talks to me and tells me to hunt and kill strangers.
3482,2,tenYr,wait ehat?
3483,2,tenYr,"TV makers sell the data of how you interact with your TV remote and the TV guide to whoever wants it. Just a small example of the insane scope in which your data is collected. Might seem useless, but it helps them design menus and see what kind of thing you like to watch etc."
3484,2,tenYr,So is your phone......
3485,2,tenYr,"Yeah but everyone knows that. Not many people realise every action you make with your TV remote is stored and sent back to the manufacturers who then sell it on. Just making an example of how deep data collection goes, your phone collecting data isn't noteworthy."
3486,2,tenYr,"So how do you not give up so much? Meaning, a lot of us dont know what the steps to privacy are when integrating tech in to life/home."
3487,2,tenYr,I... have no idea? I was just making a point that people are blind to the methods of data collection.
3488,2,tenYr,Fair enough. I as well
3489,2,tenYr,"Your phone
The tax office
Drivers licence department 
Employer 
Internet provider
Bank

Etc etc

Unless you doing some real illegal shit, what are your concerns?

I completely get where you are coming from and agree, just wondering what are we 'giving up' that would affect an average citizen?"
3490,2,tenYr,I was just referring to the data you give these companies for free and an example of one of the weird methods.
3491,2,tenYr,"Im hearing you.

The lack or privacy/giving away info isn't free - its paid for by greater convenience.

Regardless. I dont like it. And if anything, some monetary remuneration would be great!

Wild west out their in personal data land.

Options around privacy consents for apps, sign ups etc need to more than a yes or no type arrangement with clearer and more consice terms"
3492,2,tenYr,"given Facebooks function and scale, was the picture posted 10 years ago is almost guaranteed sufficient proxy for is this a picture from 10 years ago.

and if its not, you can start to iron out the kinks using more averages (like, get the average face of the person in all photos posted 10 years ago). they can even use photos other people posted of you, but didnt tag you in.

the more I think about this, the dumber the conspiracy gets. the data you would collect by a challenge like this is like a baby toy compared to the data Facebook has.

so, I agree that in terms of actually cleaning the data, this would be a more accurate way to build a reference point.

but I think that is *so far* from being a bottleneck its absurd. and if youre *really* going to do some giant secret conspiracy meme for the purpose of data cleaning, this is really gonna be the data point you use it for...?

a better strategy right off the bat would be to just classify all the challenges and memes and things that happen organically. youd have magnitudes more data, for none of the responsibility."
3493,2,tenYr,"Yeah, the photos people have already uploaded to facebook over the last 15 years is a much cleaner dataset than some random photo someone decides is ""10 years apart"". Especially when a fair amount of people probably upload joke posts.

It's funny, people make fun of Q conspiracy theories, but then come up with this bullshit conspiracy themselves lol."
3494,2,tenYr,"Youre missing an important angle. For the
10 year challenge people are going to pick the pictures that they believe are the most dissimilar, as thats kind of the point of the challenge. Therefore the data Facebook may have wanted is, we need 10million people to submit their most dissimilar set of pictures 10 years ago and now."
3495,2,tenYr,Especially since Facebook had automatic uploads back in the day (not sure if they still have this) where any photo you take is automatically uploaded
3496,2,tenYr,"Between upload dates and EXIF data, the number of incorrectly dated pictures is probably insignificant.

This is what I don't agree with on these posts about social media giants trying to basically phish information out of you, or your phone listening to you when idle... They don't have to! The vast majority of their users hand over this information willingly, the same way most Google users tell Google everything about themselves with the searches they use.

The old way of espionage was listening bugs and tracking software, but now it's all big data. They'll take everything you willingly give them and parse out or extrapolate the details they want.

It's definitely already happening, not even really a conspiracy because they don't seem to give a fuck who knows."
3497,2,tenYr,If only there was an upload date on facebook photos....
3498,2,tenYr,I didnt realize every pic uploaded to Facebook was supposed to be a live shot.
3499,2,tenYr,"Its not, but metadata in the photo can indicate when the photo was taken, where it was taken, and what camera was used. Additionally they probably have millions if not billions of photos that were automatically uploaded at capture time using their auto upload feature"
3500,2,tenYr,"Sure but woulnt it be nice if your data organized itself without having to wade through all that shit? No false positives, no memes or cat pictures. Your data picking out the best pictures and grouping them up for you."
3501,2,tenYr,"The machine wades through it, it would take maybe seconds for most people's profiles (likely less than a 1/4 second as the database already knows which photos have faced and which don't). There's nothing stopping someone from shit posting for the 10 year challenge and tainting the dataset, and there's nothing stopping someone from doing a 10 year challenge of their cat"
3502,2,tenYr,You would do both. I dont see what makes you think they wouldn't.
3503,2,tenYr,"I didn't say that, you said this:

&gt;I didnt realize every pic uploaded to Facebook was supposed to be a live shot.


And so I offered an explanation as to how Facebook could leverage existing data"
3504,2,tenYr,"True but the challenge gives a literal data set, by looking up accounts they would have to shift through hundreds of photos and find accurate aging pictures, people post a lot of things that aren't their face, were as the challenge would give a literal side by side of two different ages, and if more data was needed then they could started trawling through accounts that participated.  I've done computer science and oh boy it would be a lot easier to tell a bot to look up up a literal tagged data set than to dig through hundreds if not thousands of data pieces, especially if that data set is already somewhat organized"
3505,2,tenYr,"No they litterally do a database search for photos tagged of becky from 2005 and 2015 and 2025. It would take 5 seconds to do millions of these.   
Photos are already timestampped and tagged in facebook."
3506,2,tenYr,"Agreed. There's a limit to the ""well they already have your _____, so what's the point?"""
3507,2,tenYr,"Except it's a dataset that is probably mostly tagged right - it's not likely to be reliable. How many memes and other garbage is being posted in the dataset?

For Facebook images the dataset *is* already organized - they have your faces, your friends tagging your face, etc. They already autosuggest tags using facial recognition and Google Photos even had this ability years ago. 

As a software engineer I'd find it far easier for Facebook to go through existing profiles, especially those of longtime users. The images are often tagged and for the most part they've already built a facial recognition dataset of their users. For some users they'd even have wider age ranges than just 10 years!"
3508,2,tenYr,"Even then, facebook stores all the photos and dates of the upload on their servers. Why wouldn't they just have their programs analyze those? There's millions of people that have been using facebook for 10+ years that have identifiable photos of them on there that whole time."
3509,2,tenYr,"yeah, but then you have to scrape every picture, sort through them, id which are of them which are of others, then look for variations between when the picture was posted vs when it was taken as some people post old pictures etc.  


This way they can just do a Google image search for ""10 year challenge"" and scrape all the pictures, then reject the ones that don't have the encoded background they supplied in the free app."
3510,2,tenYr,"bro. scrape every picture? sort through them?

they own the data. create a database of 10 year photos for every user in the system is a line of SQL and some opencv code copy and pasted from 1985"
3511,2,tenYr,"not facebook, the russian org that was pushing out the 10 year challenge to program AI to figure out what people look like after 10 years of aging."
3512,2,tenYr,"yea sadly whether or not you did this; the algorithm/ai would have learned enough from everyone who did, to accurately enough (80%+CI) age you and or recognize a aged you."
3513,2,tenYr,It was posted before but that hashtag significantly improved their ability to use facial recognition by auto sorting by roughly 10 year intervals and what aging looks like
3514,2,tenYr,Ok ZUCK
3515,2,tenYr,"true but having a known data point such as knowing two pictures are exactly ten years apart is pretty valuable for verifying what they assume based on all the other stuff they know.

They make a lot of assumptions based on your data and any time they can confirm something it's very valuable."
3516,2,tenYr,"Yeah but now you have 2 pictures on an exact time span. To know this in other data, you have additional processes."
3517,2,tenYr,Makes it easy to scrape up with a bot this way at least.
3518,2,tenYr,"If the intelligence surveillance capabilities are as widespread and effective as has been repeatedly stated, you could never post a single photo of yourself online and there is still a metric fuckton of data thats been collected from you. How humanity allowed itself to peacefully surrender the entire concept of privacy and cheer its demise is incomprehensible to me."
3519,2,tenYr,But the key is tagged content. Cant train a neural net for something specific like agung iver 10 years from a bunch of ambiguous dat. If you have clearly tagged content its easy. This is still pretty unlikely tho
3520,2,tenYr,You guys ever think about how many people have willingly shipped off a sample of their DNA and wonder what purpose that might serve?
3521,2,tenYr,"[Family Tree](http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/family-tree-dna-fbi) is very public that it shares DNA information with the FBI to help find relatives of unclaimed bodies or to compare to DNA collected at a crime scene. 

The FBI used genealogy to [find the Golden State Killer](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2020/06/30/genetic-genealogy-golden-state-killer) in 2018."
3522,2,tenYr,"Yes. Ive done 23 and me and if some relative of mine was a serial killer, I sure hope the FBI uses my spit to lock the fucker up."
3523,2,tenYr,"Cringe =,"
3524,2,tenYr,Adopted children hit the privacy jackpot.
3525,2,tenYr,"I think Ancestry started to do direct family link reports at some point. Autoloads into their genealogy program. Some ppl say that's how they found siblings the parents tried to hide =,>#"
3526,2,tenYr,"Ive really wanted to do a DNA ancestry test out of pure curiosity but havent because I dont trust these people/companies. I dont know what they could or would do, but Im sure the fine print probably forgoes all my rights. I have considered doing it with a friend and switching our names just to throw off the records, but itd have to be someone I trust enough to be sure they havent committed serious crimes and left DNA at the scene hah."
3527,2,tenYr,Just don't go around killing or raping people and there's nothing to worry about. They share the info with the FBI to find matches to criminals they're looking for. There's really nothing that can be done to harm you unless you're on a wanted list.
3528,2,tenYr,Unless it somehow gets leaked and your insurance company gets a hold of it and now suddenly your health history makes you a risky asset for them. Obviously this is hyperbole and isnt even close to happening right now but thats the fear if we continue not caring about our data as we have been.
3529,2,tenYr,"This is all anecdotal but, I was super skeptical about all of that stuff at first.  Data harvesting and all that jazz.  Then my girlfriend who never knew her father decided to do it.  Several months later she gets a Facebook message from someone claiming to be her cousin and she knows everyone in the family so somebody must have have a secret love child.  She gets into contact with her would-be father and guess what, my girlfriend is the spitting image of this man's mother.  34 years old and she finally got to meet her dad for the first time.  We went to visit 2 years ago and it's like we have an entire new family now.

Just food for thought."
3530,2,tenYr,"Similar thing here. My grandmother lost touch with her first cousin after her family moved from Israel to New York in \~1960.

My half uncle did 23andMe and found my grandmother's cousin! She has a family about the same size as ours--our family size doubled overnight!"
3531,2,tenYr,"I warned a few people about this! Nevermind the nefarious possibilities, the insurance companies will have a field day with this info. What - grandma had cancer? You probably will get it one day too, then. No coverage for you!"
3532,2,tenYr,Oncologists order genetic screening blood tests sometimes.
3533,2,tenYr,The person has access and can share their info accurately or just show a doctor the whole thing.
3534,2,tenYr,Too bad an ethical society can't exist under capitalism
3535,2,tenYr,Nor under any system that involves imperfect humans.
3536,2,tenYr,This. First time Ive finally seen somebody point out the real problem with capitalism. It isnt the capitalism. Its the humans that run it. Same with any other economic base. Youre always gunna have people ready and willing to abuse whatever system is in place so that they have money and/or power.
3537,2,tenYr,There is literally no economic or political system that we won't fuck up.
3538,2,tenYr,"Exactly this. The systems we create are impressive and near perfect on paper but once put in to practice with humans who have the possibilities of manipulating and lying, then we end up with things like the USSR or the Chinese under Mao"
3539,2,tenYr,Its all about the money boys (and girls)!
3540,2,tenYr,Pretty hard to fuck up absolute anarchism
3541,2,tenYr,Instituting absolute anarchism is the fuck up itself lol.
3542,2,tenYr,That would be fucked up in the sense that it would cease to exist as soon as groups of people rediscover that you can make other people do what you want if youre stronger than they are.
3543,2,tenYr,Getting to absolute anarchism is the fuck up
3544,2,tenYr,This is true enough but just because no system can be perfect doesn't mean that all systems are equal. Capitalism has a ton of glaring flaws that other systems do not
3545,2,tenYr,"Only because it gets abused, and people let it get abused, all in the name of climbing up the corporate ladder. What happened to the capitalism that was a bunch of small, local businesses? I always thought monopolies were illegal, yet when you think of consumerism, only a handful of companies typically come to mind."
3546,2,tenYr,"Regardless of how much you try and regulate capitalism it has a big flaw: wage theft. By definition owners will always steal from workers in a capitalist system. For small businesses this is less of a problem because most owners are workers and work very hard but as you scale up a single person in the owner class at a company can own more than thousands of workers. Even if this person works very hard they cannot work thousands or millions of times harder than any other worker. 

Fixing that big problem with capitalism is called socialism and takes many forms. It can be as simple as redistributing wealth so that companies are owned by their workers."
3547,2,tenYr,Or capitalism also rewards work in the sense you can grow your business the more work you put in. Investing in yourself and your money.
3548,2,tenYr,"So, what you're saying is that the workers should stop merely being wage slaves and seize ownership of their company (but not release that power to the State)?.... I wonder if anyone else has had a similar idea and Marxed it down, or perhaps has maybe written a manifesto about this idea? (/s for good measure)"
3549,2,tenYr,"The problem is corporatism and the elimination of competition.  I used to work for a small company that got bought by a larger company.  A year later that company got bought by an even larger company.  A couple years after that, they got bought by an even larger company.  So where you used to have four companies of various sizes, now you have one huge corporation.  Also, the whole ""economy of scale"" excuse is bullshit.  These companies have crappy customer service because there are so few of them they don't have to care."
3550,2,tenYr,"Sure, alright buddy.

Maybe its not the system but the people? Even if we didnt use money they would want something and people will team up to get more for themselves.

Communists just hide their corruption better well capitalists just wear their green on their sleeves.

Both suck balls but at least you can say you hate capitalism and keep your fingers."

3553,2,tenYr,eugenics weirdos tend to win out on that kind of thing.
3554,2,tenYr,Yeah but why would doctors want to? They make money from selling you drugs.
3555,2,tenYr,"That is a nefarious possibility and Im sure the insurance companies are chomping at the bit for it, but we can legislate against it. Although with so many politicians bought off we cant be sure. 

Not every consumer dna service offers medical analysis. Most of the basic packages are just ancestry. I was tempted to buy the more expensive medical + ancestry deal because supposedly it can give you a breakdown of potential illnesses in the future like likelihood of cancer. Some people dont want to know, but if I am 90% likely to get some kind of disease I want to be prepared. This kind of service should be offered by a doctor though and not a private company"
3556,2,tenYr,"THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN TELLING EVERYONE TOO!  

First time i hear someone else mention exactly this and I'm glad I'm not the only one..."
3557,2,tenYr,"There is a [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act) that hopefully prevents some of the sharing issues. Not every type of insurance is bound by it, and it is far from perfect, but there has been some attempt to help with some of those issues.  I for one am a bit skeptical. I'm waiting for the day someone with a smart refrigerator has their health insurance rates skyrocket due to the amount of butter they eat."
3558,2,tenYr,"I, too, saw Gattaca."
3559,2,tenYr,Glad to hear you supports provisions of the ACA!
3560,2,tenYr,"That wouldn't be an issue with universal health care though, so only an issue in 'murkuh"
3561,2,tenYr,Its not an issue in Murica either. That would be illegal.
3562,2,tenYr,You think that all the ~~bribery~~ lobbying that insurance does to congress will keep it that way?
3563,2,tenYr,Protection of medical records has only gotten stricter in my lifetime despite lobbyists.
3564,2,tenYr,"HIPAA has only been a thing since the 90's.

The Fairness Doctrine was a thing for almost 40 years and all it took was a single party congress and president to get rid of it because.... something something business' freedumbs to sell ad space in between whatever nonsense they want to peddle that keeps you outraged enough to keep watching, so I wouldn't put anything past this country at all."
3565,2,tenYr,"That's my whole point. I was a teenager by the time HIPPA came around, and then after that the ACA etc. It's only gotten progressively better over my entire lifetime despite lobbyists."
3566,2,tenYr,aka GATTACA
3567,2,tenYr,If enough people in your family have done it they can easily figure yours out
3568,2,tenYr,Ive flushed many samples of mine down the toilet and shower drain.
3569,2,tenYr,I did it before I realised quite how doomed we were. Think it's too late for me now.
3570,2,tenYr,TestMyDNA dot bullshit- find your ancestory blah blah blah for sure
3571,2,tenYr,"heard all kinds of theories around that from bio weopon targeting, to lot of it ends up in isreal so maybe they're trying to id the jewish lost tribes."
3572,2,tenYr,"I shipped off my DNA, so what. Whats going to happen? Are they going to clone me? Because that would be amazing. They can do whatever they want with my DNA, i dont care."
3573,2,tenYr,Most people are worried about the insurance implications.
3574,2,tenYr,So only an issue in 'murkuh
3575,2,tenYr,"No, life insurance and private insurance still exist in most places. We have public health care here but private/insurance is still better if youre lucky enough to have it"
3576,2,tenYr,"Sure the risk is there, but right now that's not a thing. For me the risk is small enough and the benefit large enough that it's worth it to me."
3577,2,tenYr,"You're not allowed to lie to the insurance company if you learn you have a genetic disposition for certain diseases. I know nothing would happen, but technically it's illegal."
3578,2,tenYr,"I've never been asked by insurance companies about my genetic disposition for anything.

Are people being asked for this information?"
3579,2,tenYr,"The idea is that in the future insurance companies will have access to this type of data and be able to refuse you insurance based upon your genetic makeup.

Think MS, ALS, Parkinson's. If they have access to your genetic makeup, they may want to charge you extra throughout the years, refuse you outright, or drop you right as you develop symptoms.

It's a very dystopian viewpoint, but I can totally see it happening based on our current healthcare system. It's to the benefit of the insurance company to refuse as many payouts as possible. If they could figure out whether or not you might get MS by 45, you bet your ass they're not gonna wanna be covering you during that time. Or the could try to call it a pre-existing condition, saying that because of your genetics you were always going to have it."
3580,2,tenYr,"I'd hate to see it happen, but someone made the same point to me a while back. Some employers already swab mouths looking for nicotine during new hire screening. Actually, the hospital I worked at did it for a couple of years, while we had coverage through a particular insurance company nobody was really happy with. When we went back to Blue Cross Blue Shield, the swabs and drug testing stopped."
3581,2,tenYr,"Man law enforcement agencies have a hard enough time getting info from other agencies as it is. I moved from MA to SC with a driving record a mile long and the SC insurance companies and DMV told me I had a perfect driving record and I got cheap ass insurance. This is a case where this type of information should be available. Shit, it is available. All they have to do is run a background check. 

No way in hell your DNA is gonna be available to some central registry shared by a bunch of private insurance companies after being collected by some other private company that sells gimmicky ancestry info."
3582,2,tenYr,Those agencies aren't for profit entities. Insurance is a multi-billion dollar industry. That's a pretty good incentive.
3583,2,tenYr,Car insurance is for profit.
3584,2,tenYr,"But isn't genetic information protected by [HIPPA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/354/does-hipaa-protect-genetic-information/index.html#:~:text=Yes%2C%20genetic%20information%20is%20health,plan%2C%20or%20health%20care%20clearinghouse.), the [EEOC](https://www.eeoc.gov/genetic-information-discrimination) and health insurance is explicitly barred from using that information against you?

Edit: removed last link"
3585,2,tenYr,Imagine living in a third world country and still relying on private companies to handle your medical care.
3586,2,tenYr,"For the poor, we have a terrible Healthcare system. For the well insured and affluent, the absolute best. Elites from all countries come to the US for treatments."
3587,2,tenYr,There's no such thing as well insured. You're either getting ripped off or have no coverage.
3588,2,tenYr,"Sorry, that just isn't true."

3592,2,tenYr,That's the way I feel about so much of this stuff. An aging algorithm?? Oh NO
3593,2,tenYr,I don't think they would use your DNA for cloning.  But it could be used to find out what your biological weaknesses are.
3594,2,tenYr,My biological weakness is being human.
3595,2,tenYr,"Until they misidentify you as a criminal. Until they determine your life isn't worth living. Until they determine you have a genealogical chance of doing something against the law because your type genes say so.

Not only no insurance but no loans, no security clearance, or any high paying gigs for you."
3596,2,tenYr,"Lol high paying gigs will turn me away because of my DNA? Explain that one, that seems hilarious to me. Also, what kind of minorty report database is accusing people of crimes they havent committed yet? Lol"
3597,2,tenYr,"*Minority Report* is Hollywood*, ""lol""."
3598,2,tenYr,"Yea, that's it, they're going to clone you..."
3599,2,tenYr,I knew it.
3600,2,tenYr,Fancy a very sinister tin foil hat theory? Last year the Chinese were accused of buying a lot of dna data from the west. What if it could be weaponised? To identify a strand that exists in Western dna but not Asian and then produce a virus or disease that only would attack people of that dna strand. It bears thinking about especially when you consider all the allegations made about wuhan
3601,2,tenYr,"Sounds sick, Im an anarchistic. I support anything that gets us closer to the end."
3602,2,tenYr,"Noah's ark type shit? 

It's arguable what Noah had was merely the genetic information of male and female from each species. In other words, you could recreate this world."
3603,2,tenYr,Lol
3604,2,tenYr,This isnt even a secret. 23 and me does this. Ancestry dot com does it too.
3605,2,tenYr,Mainly cashing in on gullible people.
3606,2,tenYr,My mom believes they take it to find out if youre B type blood. Apparently the giants called Nephilim were B type or something and so theyre using it to make clones ? Not sure what I think but I never rule out any possibilitys
3607,2,tenYr,Yeah people dont realize they sell that information to health insurance companies.
3608,2,tenYr,Did anyone besides teens and young adults do this? Who wants to to call attention to ten years of aging and invite that kind of scrutiny? Lol
3609,2,tenYr,"Whats scary is that they also got the same age range to put on fun face filters (bunny ears and such) that change when you move your facial movements a certain way. They literally have all the information they need to do a deep fake of you whenever they feel the need. 

Imagine in 20 years person x wants to run for office, well we can't have that, heres a deep fake of them saying racist shit from 10 years ago, oh they deny saying it? That's exactly what a racist would say, judge for yourself, the camera doesn't lie......."
3610,2,tenYr,"six months before covid was a thing, face mask filters were all over snapchat."
3611,2,tenYr,oMG bRo dEep StAtE sNaPcHaT
3612,2,tenYr,"If you think about it seemingly mundane social tools like Facebook, snapchat, whatsapp, Instagram etc are the perfect places to harvest this data. So yes actually, deep state is in snapchat."
3613,2,tenYr,check yourself into hospital if you think mask filters were all part of the deep states plan to condition us to COVID..
3614,2,tenYr,Whoa! Bad!!
3615,2,tenYr,? They have admitted to collecting data and selling it. What are you not getting?
3616,2,tenYr,That's pretty freaky actually. Predictive programming I wonder?
3617,2,tenYr,Or maybe theres a whole continent called Asia where people used face masks for decades
3618,2,tenYr,"Damn, they created a whole continent for it. This goes all the way to the top."
3619,2,tenYr,Lmao! That was great.
3620,2,tenYr,"Only some people in Japan, not whole Asia man."
3621,2,tenYr,wow so deep; not like it was common use in Asia to wear masks when sick.
3622,2,tenYr,"I remember that, and thought it was weird. Then as I was using SC I'm like hmm no more mask filters..weird"
3623,2,tenYr,"Oh shit, I never thought of that. But I havent ever used those filter things."
3624,2,tenYr,"Face mask filters have nothing to do with deep fakes. They just draw cartoons based on video input. It's video data that is needed for deep fakes, any video will do."
3625,2,tenYr,"Surely It's the programme that puts the 'mask' (or other effect) on though? So your camera is recording your face and facial movements while the programme just overlays the selected effect over the top? That's how I understand it. The reasoning could be that while a decent deep fake programme could simulate you from a few frames of video you may have a distinct feature, such as a lazy eye or nervous tick, by getting you to stare at your camera while rewarding you (making rainbows coming out of your mouth and such) for completing more complex facial movements that may not be captured during a regular video. 

Just a theory, I know next to nothing about this but I know Snapchat gets you to do weird stuff to make the effects happen and I doubt they bother saving the effect, just the video of you doing it"
3626,2,tenYr,"Yeah that makes sense, and it is true that playing with a filter does generally mean there is more video data of you in aggregate. That could make a difference if you somehow avoid other types of surveillance, I guess, but that seems like a rare case. 

With deep fakes the point is more that they're just kind scary easy to create from traditional video sources. Seeing the facial feature tracking in action though filters makes you think about it more, but it doesn't really make that video more useful. Honestly they don't really want to deep fake you anyway,  they want better facial recognition to track you more effectively because that's how they make their money."
3627,2,tenYr,"This is true, its not technically necessary to store your face to put a filter on. They go off of facial landmarks like eyes and nose. However their TOS is so vague that they definitely could store your face."
3628,2,tenYr,"My point is that the images of your face are a function of taking video. The filter has nothing to do with anything, other than making you think about farcical recognition. 

You might notice that none of the deep fake videos you've ever seen have involved snapchat filters. There is a reason for that."
3629,2,tenYr,"You are right that filters dont have anything to do with FR except to encourage people to put their face on cam. 

There is some research on using deepfakes to compress video calls, basically only sending info about how your face moves and reconstructing it on the other end. This is basically a hyperrealistic snapchat filter of your own face. The problem is most computers arent powerful enough to do it yet. 

https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502003/nvidia-ai-videoconferencing-maxine-platform-face-gaze-alignment-gans-compression-resolution"
3630,2,tenYr,"When police use facial recognition to arrest you they are contractually prevented from naming the FR company (usually Clearview AI). So they will arrest you and you sit in jail for a few days while they figure out if youre the bad guy.

One of the problems is their facial recognition is really bad. Like really bad. Especially for black people. So black people are getting arrested by software even though theyre completely innocent and sitting in jail, meanwhile they lose their job because they didnt show up to work."
3631,2,tenYr,The technology to detect deep fakes is developed almost as quickly as deep fake tech.
3632,2,tenYr,"Imagine RN.

You wouldn't be able to tell if it was Joe Biden or Jim Carrey... 

That's a fact.

(Because you can't)"
3633,2,tenYr,As a young person I never did this immediately I thought hmm yeah I'm good. I rather not give zuck my current face(haven't uploaded shit to Facebook since I was about 12 or so). I don't even take pictures anymore.
3634,2,tenYr,Are you in anyone elses pictures? I just seen recently how FB will find you in other pictures with facial recognition and tag you. Its weird stuff lol
3635,2,tenYr,How do you know it's not the uploader themselves tagging you?
3636,2,tenYr,"It has a thing that explains it when it does it, I believe you can turn it off though."
3637,2,tenYr,"Yup, did that to me one day when someonr posted a picture of me and an ex in 9th grade, from 1997. It gave me a notification that said someone posted a picture of you. I barely recognized myself."
3638,2,tenYr,"Probably the uploader, who tagged you in the photo.

You can turn off others ability to tag you in photos in the settings."
3639,2,tenYr,I wasn't tagged in the photo. I had commented on it and after that they tagged me.  They didn't even know it was me until I said something.
3640,2,tenYr,Nope like I haven't taken any type of picture since I was about 16. So 5 years now. Nobody has taken one of me to my knowledge. My fiancee gets mad at me bc I refuse to take any type of pictures. Idk I'm just to paranoid
3641,2,tenYr,"Make sure you get your wedding pictures on film then! Black and white film can be developed at home. I appreciate your carefulness but as a woman, I do feel for your fiancÈe a bit."
3642,2,tenYr,Thats smart these days lol the super A.I will watch you through traffic cameras and ATM cameras to update its database. = lol jk
3643,2,tenYr,Oh probably so lol but I mean if we comparing that quality to what we have in our pockets I think I'm safe. I mean 20 years and they still have cameras that look like it was dipped in TV static smh. How tf they expect me to identify someone if idk if that's even a person or a damn tree lol
3644,2,tenYr,Clearly thats just a phishing/identity theft scam. Asking questions that a lot of people use for passwords and stuff.
3645,2,tenYr,Oh God lmao that was definitely a scam email. Lol mothers maiden name. Just answer all these security questions ans we will find a picture of you for sure lol
3646,2,tenYr,Yeah. Definitely a scam. Phishing for answers to security questions.
3647,2,tenYr,"I'm in my 50s and people all over facebook I knew did it.  They also do those quizzes they put out to farm your data.  I try and try to tell them not to but they don't listen to ""conspiracy theories""."
3648,2,tenYr,"As a 33 year old, this is the first I'm I'm hearing about it."
3649,2,tenYr,The older he gets the more alien he looks. Definitely needs a software and hardware upgrade.
3650,2,tenYr,"How about adding a fun filter that changes when you do a certain facial expression also? 'If I raise my eyebrow the bunny ear goes down'.... yeah, they've also just captured how your face reacts in certain situations."
3651,2,tenYr,"Fuck, never thought this before."
3652,2,tenYr,The exact same thing is being done with the no makeup challenge. Ladies post one picture with makeup and one without and the algorithm gets smarter.
3653,2,tenYr,"What if I told you that you already renew a picture directly for the goverment every 10 years, usually on your birthday?"

3656,2,tenYr,You sicken me with your.... your logic
3657,2,tenYr,Jokes on you. Whenever I renew my ID I use the same photo I took way back when I was 18 lol
3658,2,tenYr,Every 4 for a drivers license.
3659,2,tenYr,This is where the FBI gets their face database. Its not even a secret. You guys might think theyre morally better than the Chinese gov but actually theyre just less competent. Their goals are the same. Control.
3660,2,tenYr,Their facial recognition technology is actually trash lmao. My buddy was investigated by the FBI for supposedly being at the capitol riot and the picture they had to cross reference him with was hilarious.
3661,2,tenYr,Yeah it is. It still causes problems though since people get arrested and lose their jobs based on some shit software.
3662,2,tenYr,Well they also went to his job to confirm if he was working that day and had to look at the GPS data on where he was driving. I hope theyre not arresting people without doing work like that. Thats shitty.
3663,2,tenYr,"Yeah unfortunately it happens

3664,2,tenYr,Wow thats fucked up
3665,2,tenYr,"My girlfriend has had the same picture on her license since she was 20, so roughly 12 years. I dont think you always have to take a new picture, although you might want to as you age in case you need to identify yourself to like police or something."
3666,2,tenYr,This is old news though lol
3667,2,tenYr,"Not a conspiracy, but more of a fun fact: all the captcha data is being feed into self driving car deep learning systems. Thats why theyre always street related (select all stop signs, cars, busses, hills, crosswalk, etc)."

3673,2,tenYr,"Not a conspiracy. Its the stated purpose. When we used to type words, that was being used to digitize books."
3674,2,tenYr,"Yup.

3675,2,tenYr,It's not true lol
3676,2,tenYr,been thinking this for a long time
3677,2,tenYr,"It's been public information since they started doing it, like someone said above, when it was done with words it was to digitize books.

3682,2,tenYr,"Once again, can you tell me whats strange about ive been thinking about this for a long time? I mean, I didnt know Re-captcha actually said we were training AIs while solving them. But I could really imagine that. Thats all I said.

The only plausible reason an AI would ""lean right"" is because essentially no critical thinking is required to lean conservative. Receive endless data about equality and be racist regardless. Receive endless data that trickle down economics has never worked and continue to cut taxes for the rich. Witness police brutalize and kill minorities and say blue lives matter. Etc etc. To be a Republican AI there is no ""learning"" typically associated with artificial intelligence, but rather just a mindless brainwashing period."

That was absolutely beautiful."

3730,2,tenYr,"How so? Even if the AI is just allowed to scroll specific sites and receives specific data, the AI always develops alr-right ideas. The Facebook AI from a few years ago was one of the best examples of this. It started getting racist and antisemitic so they shut it down. It's a really interesting story if you have time."

I mean the pics people post for these types of things are probably not high quality and clear enough to even be useful for their computers to recognize"
3781,2,tenYr,"Whether or not this is the intent of the challenge, companies are absolutely using the photos that you post on social media to make a fingerprint of your face. And even if you dont post photos of yourself on social media, they still have your drivers license and anytime youve been on security camera."
3782,2,tenYr,I like the realization of this about ten years after the challenge an the lack of realization that they didn't start it and they wouldn't need to because they already had ten years of photos with the dates you posted them and your own tags off yourself and friends. They also have an AI feature that's been very good at guessing since like 2011.

My instincts were spot on."
3810,2,tenYr,It was pretty obvious that this was not some fun trend for some laughs. It was a cleverly hidden machine learning project which will eventually be used some time later (may be few years) to track people across the globe.
3811,2,tenYr,"Whats with all the old posts? 

Also, Facebook doesnt need to do this, they have access to all your pictures already. Its scary how much info Facebook has on everyone."
3812,2,tenYr,"guys. Facebook having your &gt;10 years of photos doesn't mean the system can surely recognise you and 10-years-younger-you as the same person. For machine learning to improve accurancy, it needs human to manually confirm the data. Some company pay epople to do. And the 10yearchallenge is really to attract people to facebook's AI for free."
3813,2,tenYr,"Uhh interesting theory, but I think people really just wanted to see the difference of 10 years.."
3814,2,tenYr,The DMV already has a photo of me from the time I was 16 to present... stupid post.
3815,2,tenYr,"Facebook doesn't have access to the DMV database of photos.

So...stupid comment?"
3816,2,tenYr,This is so stupid.
3817,2,tenYr,"Also make people wear masks, so that the algorithm has less of the face to train with."
3818,2,tenYr,Facebook started 15 years ago. They have plenty of photos of people from 10 years ago. Maybe if they started a 25 year challenge or something lol
3819,2,tenYr,He looks exactly the same on both pictures
3820,2,tenYr,Rich people dont age. ;)
3821,2,tenYr,Thats been known for years. How is that a conspiracy?
3822,2,tenYr,"What is your big secret alien conspiracy here bro? Please I want to be WOKE just like you! Share a valid link perhaps? Can you also see how it will be like 10 years from now? You must be ahead of our time, keep it up bro!"
3823,2,tenYr,So in your opinion they dont already have enough pictures of people aging even though you can go back more than 10 years on many peoples facebooks? There are people who post every day and have for many years so if you think critically about this at all it doesnt stand up.

Before that I worked on factory type projects and spent time in China. I've seen what passes for quality control and what is deemed acceptable in construction practices. Everything is rushed because the culture values getting things done quickly over getting things done correctly. 

In normal circumstances at a BSL 4 lab, you spend about 4 hours split between preparing and cleaning up afterwards for every 1 hour of work you get done in the lab. So in an 8 hour day, a researcher only gets an hour of lab time, 2 hours of paperwork, and 4 hours just getting into/out of the lab.  There's no doubt in my mind a lab in China would have cut corners here, which would have allowed the virus to lazily walk out of the lab (if the lab was even properly built in the first place)."
3840,2,covid,"Sure, but in hindsight it's very easy to see it was NOT an accident.

3891,2,covid,"Thats my point. If this was on purpose, theyd do better than COVID-19. 2 million people wouldve actually died. Lockdowns would be much tighter. Big Brother would kick your door in and jab you with the vaccine no matter what. Instead, we got Hey, yo, dont have big gathering, cool?

3904,2,covid,"So the virus is fake, a hoax, harmless but also a dangerous Chinese bioweapon.

*Makes perfect sense*"
3905,2,covid,"Lab-created doesnt automatically mean bioweapon and doesnt automatically mean it was intentionally leaked. It is still a huge fucking deal if governments have been shady about the origins of a global pandemic.

Youre not even curious to discover from whence it came? Even a lil bit?"
3906,2,covid,"That's what I'm thinking. Even if it was accidentally released and not being developed as a bio-weapon it's still shady as hell that they're trying to cover up how it was ""made"" and why. Why do we need to be messing with viruses and making them stronger? Why are they denying that the US funded research in wuhan? Something stinks, but jumping to conclusions is silly."
3907,2,covid,"&gt; Lab-created doesnt automatically mean bioweapon

3912,2,covid,"It wasn't derided as vile you disingenuous clown. Within a month of the outbreak in north america every news station quoted a retired israeli intelligence official who was the first to publicly say it came from a lab. Although he took it a step further and said it came from a military lab NOT wuhan institute of virology. 

 Of course at the end of their report they say say there isn't any evidence of it. Although if you know how the media works it doesn't matter if there wasn't any evidence, they ran the story and it was instilled in everyones consciousness.

You can look it up yourself and see every mainstream channel ran that retired officials theory within a month of the outbreak here."
3913,2,covid,"That may be true, but I specifically remember people being called ""racists"" last Summer for suggesting it was an intentional leak from China. Not saying those people were important people but that sentiment was out there. I don't watch the news, so I don't know if they were pushing that or not. But there were some sheep that got that idea from somewhere."
3914,2,covid,"Well of course that happened since they knew there would be backlash on the asian community(even if it is just negative sentiment) for them shutting everything down with poorer people feeling it the most while Xi and Trump play the blame game, kicked off mind you by exactly i cant remember which accusation came first the retired official or the military games accusation.

Its funny too because through all of this the US stock market hitting record highs and China's economy doing great."

3916,2,covid,Remember each and every person and outlet who gaslighted you on this.
3917,2,covid,I think across mm the Covid origination has never been really concrete one way or another. Difference now is that more variables are in the mix 14 months later because of the vaccine uncertainty along with shockingly new cdc mask protocols. Not to mention some conveniently timed unusual recent news headlines.

3920,2,covid,"Your argument is moot. The virus first appeared in the Midwest in the summer of 2019, 8 months before Wuhan. It was covered up as the so called ""Vape"" illness, and there were over 20,000 more ""Flu"" deaths that fall than any previous year. All well before the so called Wuhan outbreak. Wuhan was just a convenient patsy. Also, China literally cremated all traces of the virus in Wuhan after the outbreak there. Sick and healthy people alike, mass burning of bodies. Detectable levels sulfur that indicated 10s of thousand of bodies were burned."
3921,2,covid,Wasn't it found in sewer samples from Barcelona back in Spring of 2019?
3922,2,MAML,I remember my art history 101 prof telling us about this kind of thing in 1989. Big scam that's been going on since forever.
3923,2,MAML,I'm mostly interested in how I can break into this business. I know for sure I can make some shit tier art like a banana taped to a canvass that I took a shit on and I can easily get it appraised for that $20 Million
3924,2,MAML,"Are you already a millionaire?

Just because you can get it appraised for 20 million doesn't mean you can sell it for 20 million.... That's the point...

You use the fake value of the art peice to write down your taxes"
3925,2,MAML,"You also need friends on the Museum board so you can get them to accept your shit stain. That will probably cost you a couple Hundred Thousand one way or another, donations, bribes,etc."
3926,2,MAML,"This is an underrated comment and a big part of donating. In order to get the tax write-off, the appraiser is hired by the museum. Which is not to say they all don't know each other, but you can't get your own donation appraised. Also, museums don't always want $20 million artworks just because they are offered."
3927,2,MAML,So now I've got to start my own museum too? How much does that cost??
3928,2,MAML,Just get some male models to do it.

3934,2,MAML,My friend does this with gemstones to wash his weed growing money...
3935,2,MAML,Shhhhhh
3936,2,MAML,I guess I blew up the spot...though it's legal where he's at so he has entirely new loopholes to jump through.
3937,2,MAML,As we say...its legal if you dont get caught. Tell him to watch colored stones. You can get your dick slammed in the door fast unless your super sharp on stones
3938,2,MAML,"I'll tell him and I'll check it out as well.


He's really up on his knowledge on stones and actually sells them for a living. But he wasn't making as much of a living on it. So he ""gifted"" gemstones with his herb for a bit until he could start getting ""legit"" money from dispensaries.*(I quote ""legit money"" because most banks wouldn't accept it)



Was hilarious when a dude came by to get a pound and left with a pound of weed and a flat of gemstones, with a receipt for purchase of said gemstones for a reasonable price."
3939,2,MAML,"Yo if this is AZ, this would be the most Tuscon fucking thing I've heard. Bet the dude cleans house during the gem show"
3940,2,MAML,"We love the Tuscon Gem Show. 



Don't get it too twisted though. We love our Gemstones. Dude doesn't ever try and chop people's heads or take advantage of people who know nothing about gemstones. I've seen him lose money on them because the stone needed to go with someone who desperately wanted it but was some traveling kid who's broke af. 



The cannabis game actually allowed him to spread that gemstone love around. I know I love watching people light up when I just give them one of my crystals that they're somehow obsessively drawn to.


 One friend of mine was having dreams about one of my favorite Pyrite pieces. I wasn't *that* attached to the stone so I just gave it to him. I watched a 27 year old fairly depressed dude, turn into a 7 year old that just opened the best Xmas present ever...good times"
3941,2,MAML,oooh that is clever.
3942,2,MAML,"This is happening in DC now. Weed is legal but since the DC budget is approved by congress, congress won't let DC sell it. So you have people all around town selling stickers for $50, and giving an eighth as a gift along with it."
3943,2,MAML,"Right? He looked at it like he was just selling weed at a discount because you were buying some gemstones.


So, technically that could hold up in court I think"
3944,2,MAML,Jesus Christ Marie
3945,2,MAML,"Same, except he was selling Magic the Gathering cards to launder his drug money. He ended up making more money on magic than growing weed, so now he's just buying/selling magic cards."
3946,2,MAML,"LMFAO!!!!!!


I'm crying over here...holy shit. Tell your friend he's legendary in my book"
3947,2,MAML,Yo did we have the same drug dealer?? His name was Tim? =
3948,2,MAML,"My friend does the same thing for his weed growing money except he just buys a $50,000 piece o fart at one of those swanky art shows and gets it reappraised."
3949,2,MAML,"Piece o' fart.

I love that. 

Please paint that on a canvas and donate it to a museum!"
3950,2,MAML,Pizza fart.
3951,2,MAML,Must be a super swanky gallery if they're selling pieces o' farts for $50k. Though I guess Eric Maplethorpe has kinda been there done that.
3952,2,MAML,"Every year they hold these big, swanky art shows in cities like New York, Berlin, Tokyo, Houston, Miami, Seattle, etc and dozens of galleries fly their art in from all over the world.  Then wealthy people, international business lawyers, interior designers, or whomever go to these shows and buy art.  Some people actually care about the art, but a lot of them just need a place to park their cash.  But the art ranges in price from $1,000 to millions.  It's also a place where people can meet artists for custom commissions.

And if you ever hear someone described as an ""international business lawyer"", this is someone who helps wealthy people hide and launder their money.

I know, I know, shhhhhhhhh!"
3953,2,MAML,What happens after they buy fart ? how do they cash in ?
3954,2,MAML,*The FBI wants to know your location*
3955,2,MAML,"Lol...I'm pretty sure I've been flagged for a long time. When I was 18 I had 2 of my friends being watched by the DEA. One of them evidently had been watched for 2 years before they decided to bust them both. We used to even make jokes about the big silver trailer behind the used car dealership was the DEA watching the pizza joint we slung all sorts of shit out of...sure enough, it was a DEA surveillance team.



I sold small amounts of weed and ecstasy, which I got from the friends who got busted. Lucky they didn't bother picking me and a few others in our group who were all just selling drugs(*weed, ecstasy, mushrooms) to support their own drug habits. I stopped all that, moved an hour away, got 2 jobs, and just bought weed to smoke it."
3956,2,MAML,"That's how I've looked at it. I wasn't anything big time, nor was I trying to be."
3957,2,MAML,I like how you answer questions with novels.
3958,2,MAML,Lol...honest answer. I'm lonely but don't like to physically be around people anymore..Its a weird situation
3959,2,MAML,"I appreciated the story. Enjoyable to read, glad you posted it"

3971,2,MAML,"Well don't leave us hanging... was their Wifi ""DEA Surveillance Van"""
3972,2,MAML,How'd you realize it was the DEA?
3973,2,MAML,"Oh they got busted by them. They told them that they were in the RV running surveillance.


My one buddy was buying 10,000-20,000 ecstasy pills at a time once a week. The other one sold everything under the sun, except meth I think. Kilos of cocaine, crack and heroin were moving through his hands on a weekly.


*one got 5 years. The other one (heroin&amp;coke) got 6 months in a work release minimum security. We thought he ratted someone out. Nope, his brothers went and dug up 250K he had been saving. Gave it to his lawyer, who gave it to the judge, who dropped all of his charges except the 1/4 pound of weed that was found when they raided his house."
3974,2,MAML,Takes me back to good old days that was a big blur  due to all the mdma. Good times!
3975,2,MAML,"That's real interesting to hear but at least does give some hope to the idea that they aren't necessarily focusing on the shit that doesn't do too much harm; willing to overlook folks doing small time hallucinogens and whatnot if it means they're in it for big time upper/downer type folk. Still be better if they backed the fuck up overall, but it's interesting to me that actual ""where law enforcement spends its time"" is closer to where people hope they would be spending it than busting people for relatively harmless shit. Funnily though, this only seems to happen at that level and not at the street level."
3976,2,MAML,"Honestly, it might have a bit to do with all of us being white. 



Which is something that has bummed me out when I realize how true that could be."
3977,2,MAML,"As a gemmologist, I'm curious about this."
3978,2,MAML,"Buy a bunch of opal, say you found it, sell for a  proft"
3979,2,MAML,That wouldn't work. There would be a paper trail.
3980,2,MAML,How does that work though? They would ask him where he got the original capitol for them if they go through his bank accounts and see a deposit like that .. or does he hide them or what idk Im confused lol
3981,2,MAML,"The dude had been selling gemstones before he even grew cannabis. Even had an LLC. He started the company when he worked a real job before I had met him. Went from hobby to legal side hustle.



Inventory that had been sitting around not being sold, could now find buyers. He could basically liquidate his entire inventory of crystals he purchased and hadn't been able to sell in 5-10 years.



But yeah, what you're describing is why I didn't really try too hard to do what he did. I'm not good with stuff like that. I didn't even want to break laws in the first place."
3982,2,MAML,Could you elaborate? Shit like this always interests me because I just don't get how you could stop it without harming people who are legitimately in the business
3983,2,MAML,"Legalize weed.



He was basically selling his weed for ""discount"" if people purchased gemstones from him. If someone bought 1600 worth of herb. He would take gemstones he purchased for 400 and give them to the person with their weed, and would write a receipt for a purchase of 600 worth of gemstones. Tell the people to give them as gifts to people if they didn't want to keep them


So he technically wasn't really breaking a law in the gemstone aspect. He wasn't fabricating actual gemstones being sold. Just bending the rules on how he was getting people to purchase them."
3984,2,MAML,Damn that's smart! Yea such bullshit time and resources wasted to prevent this. Shit needs to be federally legal
3985,2,MAML,"It really does. The big joke is that I was recently in DC where it's ""legal""... Just walking around smoking spliffs, cops didn't care. Some Marines I walked up to in front of the DOJ didn't care. Seemed like only the tourists were taken aback by the dreadlocked hippie smoking weed in front of the Washington monument"
3986,2,MAML,It's so backwards the people in DC keep it federally illegal but it's legalized/decriminalized there. What a fucking sham
3987,2,MAML,"And from what I hear, they sell it nearly exactly how my friend moved gemstones. You purchase a random item from the cannabis dispensary, and the amount of cannabis you want is ""gifted"" to you for your purchase. 


It's laughable."
3988,2,MAML,Bruh.  Why would you say this?
3989,2,MAML,"Well he doesn't anymore. And I highly doubt all federal agencies are unaware of gemstones being used to launder money...



I get what you're saying though. I guess I really don't give a fuck anymore. I don't think anyone is going to get arrested from my random reddit comment. If they do ""whoops"" I guess?"
3990,2,MAML,"The scam is harder to play. 

Be billionaire. Have wealth tax in Europe that taxes you for owning billions. They dont tax art.

Invest in art- radically drive up price for a few key artists. Mostly when they die so theres a fixed amount and you and your buddies just pass them around like cash. Gang decides on the value.

Your billions are now held in art currency.

Pay no wealth tax."
3991,2,MAML,Take loans out against the value of the art with the art as collateral. Maintain liquidity but have artificially lowered net worth because you now have extensive debt liability.
3992,2,MAML,... and you don't pay tax on loans
3993,2,MAML,"I wonder how closely art insiders pay attention to people trying to corner the market on specific artists.  I feel like the more valuable the art is to begin with, the more somebody would notice a surge in interest.

You could mask it with LLCs and diverse named buyers, but I feel like this has an obvious quality to it that actual art dealers would notice.   Plus the problem of needing to involve enough people in the scheme that you get all the problems associated with any scheme involving multiple people.

It also seems like it would be difficult to increase the organic demand and thus price of an artist.  If your scheme bought 8 of the 10 available works by an artist, do the remaining 2 actually go up that much in value if the first 8 were bought more or less at market price?  Or are the sellers of the remaining 2 likely to just be glad to unload the art at a minor premium, not believing the artist has really become more popular or valuable?

This might work if you had high quality art market knowledge and knew what ""trends"" to get in on early, but I also feel like ""art dealers"" are already kind of in this business and trying to capitalize on the trends, too.

I can see the art market scam working, but it seems like its a lot trickier to pull off."
3994,2,MAML,All true but the art gallery plays a non trivial economic role in this scam. The gallery must be of a certain stature that is going to be a parking place for 20 mm in fake art that almost nobody is gonna want to see except maybe to laugh at it. Gallery management is gonna demand a big wall rental fee to hang the overpriced shit than nobody will ever buy.
3995,2,MAML,Why can't the gallery also be somewhat of a phony?
3996,2,MAML,It definitely is.  I'm just saying it's an expensive and sophisticated phony and therefore costly to maintain.
3997,2,MAML,"Jesus, I now understand why one I went to literally had cutting boards with like.. a burn from a pot on it up on the wall. There was more than one... In different places."
3998,2,MAML,I doubt they have to be hanging on a wall. The gallery could have a warehouse with inventory.
3999,2,MAML,"I am artist working in Chicago. These guys definitely have a warehouse reserve. One of the big art shows in town ""Expo"" is just a warehouse show for money laundering operations of art galleries. It doesnt matter how good you are, they only have artists on display that fit the scheme."
4000,2,MAML,"Im just thinking of the guy getting paid 25k to put a line of paint on a canvas...

Id do a saver special, two lines of paint for 40k"
4001,2,MAML,"I think the art is ""donated"" to a museum, not sold.  If it were sold, it would count as income you'd have to pay taxes on, which would defeat the purpose."
4002,2,MAML,the old steve martin bit.  how to not pay taxes on a million dollars a year.  step 1: have a million dollars.
4003,2,MAML,"Not exactly how it works.

There are agencies that tell wealthy people what art to buy, these are the people controlling the whole process and basically helping millionaires hide money from taxes as outlined by OP all under the guise of helping them invest in art.

Wealthy people dont buy anything unless these people tell them too. So if you want to be one of the artists who is profiting off of this process you need to impress these investment agency pukes. Mostly its a who-you-know style scheme but they occasionally elevate random plebian artists into the process because it helps keep the process looking legitimate when you can showboat around starving artist success stories and what not."
4004,2,MAML,I'll sell that to the millionaire for 25k a pop
4005,2,MAML,"So what if I only earned $20k this year, but made a shit painting and got it appraised for $20m. If i then donated said painting, would I get a fat ass refund or would I just not pay taxes?"
4006,2,MAML,"Generally speaking the charitable donation would be tax free so the tax you would have been charged that year on $20 million of your earnings doesnt get charged, you just made $6 million dollars assuming a 30% tax rate.
In your case you might a tax credit and not pay income tax ever again but of course youre not already rich so you dont get to do that.
If a country wants to avoid this scam they just introduce legislation whereby only the first say $10,000 of charitable donations are tax free."
4007,2,MAML,"&gt; Cannibaloxfords10

To make a lot of money in art, your art is secondary. Your story, life, looks, attitude and any salacious or entertaining stories that catch the attention of the right people will mean your blobs of paint on a canvas will be worth a lot more than a finely skilled artist who just goes to bed every night at 10pm."

4011,2,MAML,He doesn't need the 20 mil just the 25k

1. Get into the ""appraisal"" business (not the art business). 
2. Offer appraisals to NON-MILLIONAIRES for $100 or so.
3. Appraise literally anything (blank canvas?) for $___ (whatever you want).
4. Setup a separate 501c charity organization. 
5. Take ""art"" donations from non-millionaires.
6. They get the write off, you get free canvasses to paint on and a $100 for paint supplies. 

I'll be your first customer."
4013,2,MAML,"If this scam becomes widespread it wouldn't work anymore and the politicians would close the loophole to make sure average chumps dont get rich off this. This loophole is only for the elites to exploit, if it gets out of control and tax revenue drops, they will close it."

It's been about 5 years and he now owns a whole trailer park and 3 rental homes and he's still going. He came in to get a business loan to go bigger and we wouldn't do it cause real estate investment is high risk. He had no idea what he was getting himself into, but it worked out for him, so far at least. I've done similar loans for dudes to purchase old CNC machines.

4044,2,MAML,"Huh. I'm in Canada as a matter of fact. That's a super interesting article. 

It's been a long time since my prof explained it to us, but IIRC basically big wig art patrons would buy directly from the artist, hold on to the art for a while, get it appraised by a friendly appraiser, and then donate it to the National Gallery (or some such public entity). 

Basically the reason it worked is that galleries take 50% commission so it's easy to find artists who will sell direct at a steep discount. Because the price is discounted from gallery rates it's easy to get an immediate appraisal for twice the amount the buyer paid right off the bat.

Give it a few years and a higher appraisal, then donate away for the tax savings. 

One of my other profs actually told us that he had buyers visit him in his studio and make offers on just random sketches they saw lying around. They weren't even arty--they were just design sketches for a piece he was working on--buy the picked out a bunch and wrote him a fat cheque. 

I have to presume that this might have been part of a similar scam to the one in the article."

However, I wouldn't say they're being poor has any relevance to that situation in the IRS unfairly targeting them, as it's the criminal behavior that caused it, kind of like how they got Capone for Tax evasion, because it was the lowest hanging fruit."

reasons off the top of my head:

1) the rich are in charge and will make the life for the investigators and their angency a living hell if the IRS went after them

2) the IRS will not win against the rich, because the rich have smart tax attorneys and accountants and know all the tricks

3) many of the rich are also attorneys themselves and can have the law changed or interpret exiting legalities creatively

4) if an IRS agent doesn't win cases, long term their career is toast.

5) if the agent gets their boss fired, long term their career is toast.

6) there are no consequences against the agent for going after normies or other small fry, and in fact, some benefits, because if they win a series of easy cases they look good."

4091,2,MAML,"FYI this is not actually how wealthy people avoid paying taxes. There are much simpler, less risky ways to get out of taxes for the wealthy. 

The grain of truth here is that wealthy people do collect as patrons groups of artists who they then promote among their well connected circles with the hopes that one of the artists will become a big name. 

Many wealthy people view collecting art as a relatively stable way of investing as a hobby. The thinking, simplified, is that once you buy a painting, you have assigned that painting a value of whatever you paid for it. Worst case, you could re-sell it for about the same price later on, or simply enjoy the piece for what it is. But like housing, the expected trajectory is that as an artist becomes more famous via promotion from benefactors, the value of the  art will only go up. 

And largely, this seems to bear out to be true. Collecting art is at worst a break even sport for most wealthy people."

And to your point, the wealthy art collectors I described *are* the market for this commodity."
4100,2,MAML,Yeah lets not forget the artists can become just as wealthy as their patrons. The idea that artist are suckling are the tits of a rich patron is fucking laughable. As you mentioned the revolt against that mind set is how the fucking banana got on the wall in the first place. This thread is bananas.
4101,2,MAML,"Yep.  Rich people are just doing what most people who call them evil would do if they were in their place.

4103,2,MAML,Writing a check is very different from donating a painting worth shit. Can you ELI5
4104,2,MAML,"Writing a check to charity is something you can effectively and predictably strategize with an accountant. A wild scheme to promote an artist's work to a $20m valuation is not.

For the wealthy, having a predictable and reliable tax avoidance scheme is more important than manufacturing $20m out of thin air, and more importantly, they don't have to use an art scheme like described to reach a $0 tax payment, so why would they?"
4105,2,MAML,"You missed the point, write a cheque and the donation value is the same as the dollars you spent.

But if your art 'appreciates' you $25k purchase can be worth significantly more as a tax deduction.

That said, the tax office should be across this. It was relevant years ago but at least in my country of Australia it's been covered, however if you never bought the art and it 'was in the family' or something there is a grey zone for abuse here.

4114,2,MAML,"Yes and no. Someone else who works in tax could do a better version of explaining the details, but the trick is that you aren't buying the real estate as a person, you're buying it as a group of investors through a company or a network of companies.

4117,2,MAML,"&gt;And largely, this seems to bear out to be true. Collecting art is at worst a break even sport for most wealthy people.

This is incorrect when compared against stocks and bonds. NPR Planet Money [did an episode](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/705290712) comparing the average price of art over time. For a specific example, they found that you'd have a -11% return on the average price of art since 2010, but a 180% return on the s&amp;p 500."
4118,2,MAML,"Solid study. Comparing something people typically keep for decades over an 8 year period, and then comparing it to the S&amp;P's longest and most extreme straight bull run in its entire history. Not cherry picked at all. 

I'm not even advocating that people avoid the s&amp;p or that they buy art as an investment, but you should be aware of the obvious inherent flaws in that comparison."
4119,2,MAML,"I don't appreciate the disingenuous sarcasm. Please read/listen to the episode.

The comparison was to highlight direction and not magnitude of returns on art versus stocks. The researcher did the same comparison between art and stocks going back to the 1700s and found that art still has a negative value on average over time."
4120,2,MAML,"Looking forward to checking that out later, but my reaction before listening to it is that while the overall average may be a poor return, its not the overall average that matters. Where there are winners, there must be losers. And Im talking about a portion of society that has a track record of winning."
4121,2,MAML,I've experienced huge losses in the sock market largely due to laundering.
4122,2,MAML,"There is a special tax rule that allows donors of artworks to deduct the fair market value of the work instead of their 'basis' (i.e. what they paid for it).  That's what OP is referring to here.  This means someone can buy an artwork, hold it for a year, then have it appraised for a much higher amount and then donate it to a qualified charity and receive a tax deduction for the appraised value, which may be much higher than the amount they paid.  Normally a donation would just entitle the donor to deduct their basis in the donated property.  This rule allows them to deduct value they never received in income."
4123,2,MAML,"Shh, it's probably a conspiracy though!"
4124,2,MAML,"The IRS allows you to deduct contributions up to 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year. So if your AGI was $100,000, you may be able to deduct $50,000 in charitable donations.  
.  
In OP's scenario, the ""millionaire"" in question could write off up to 10 million in contributions to charities. At 20 million dollars of income, in my state (No state income tax) $3,902,411 would be your federal income tax.  
."
4125,2,MAML,"OP's scenario doesn't even make sense as far as I can tell. If an artwork increased in value, then it's a capital gain. If he hires the work and makes millions from its sale, then it is profit. Either would add to the income. So the income would be [regular income] + [gain from appraised artwork]. Total income would then be $40mm. Then you can't just donate to any museum and write it off. It has to be a qualified organization. And it has to be fair market value. If he *bought* it at $20mm, then that's fair. If it increased from $25K to $20mm, that's not a [reasonable rate of increase.""](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions) In other words, some hired appraiser pulled the number out of his ass. Don't you think the IRS would not allow this? 

And lastly, why isn't this fucking artist selling his work at $20million if that's the fair market value!? Instead he sells it for a few thousand and lets some rich asshole sell it for millions. Makes no sense."
4126,2,MAML,"He didn't buy the art. He paid someone a wage to create it.

There's a difference. 

A record label could sign me to a $25k contract to write an album. If the album goes huge, they didn't pay $25k for the album. It cost them $25k to make it.

Let's say they could sell the album rights now for $1M because it's so popular. They'd be able to write off the $25k as a business expense. Let's say they donate it, they could write off the $25k and the $1M.

That's why OP had an appraiser-- to determine fair market value of art that they created.

Edit: I think people are going down the wrong rabbit holes on this one. The things people should focus on and the really interesting aspects of this conversation are the strategies that are employed to get a high appraisal with low cost and the lack of enforcement of IRS regulations which allow for abuse of the system by extremely wealthy entities."
4127,2,MAML,"If you commission/create the art you can only write off the cost basis. 

Collectibles like art are a special asset class that has extra tax stipulations to prevent what people on here think is possible."

4138,2,MAML,"Not the CPA/CMA, but the OP chain is simply wrong.

First problem - One simply can't get a friendly appraiser to ""value"" art at $20 million. They have to be a [qualified (certifications, experience, training) appraiser](http://www.marcumllp.com/insights-news/new-irs-regulations-what-constitutes-a-qualified-appraisal) and they have to submit to the IRS a written and signed appraisal. They can be fined and barred from appraisals if the simply pull a $20 million valuation out of their butt. There has to be some reasonable basis.

Problem #2 - the owner has to posses it for longer than 1 year

\#3 - as noted already, the IRS [limits charitable deductions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf) to 50% of AGI. In this case its a non-cash contribution of  capital gain item making it a 30% limit. The donor would not be able to offset their entire income from this gift.

This whole ""this is how rich people do it"" is laughable, because you can't do it this way. On purpose."
4139,2,MAML,"The real reason for buying art is not the tax deduction surely? But the ability to hold value that is not formally known until resale? Where it might have gone way up in value as well.

In some countries you pay property tax. And tax on your values if high enough. Do they charge you for simply holding onto your art? If not it is a better investment than property if you get taxed for that property value."
4140,2,MAML,"Most of the hype around the art world has been from rapidly inflating asset values. What rich person wants to say that they not only have exquisite taste in art, but also have made millions off their art investing accumen. In reality there are actually a lot of art that doesnt appreciate as expected."
4141,2,MAML,"You get taxed on the difference in price between buying and selling. This is called ""capital gains"". If you paid $10 for the painting, and then sell it for $110 you'd get taxed on $100. Capital gains tax is usually more favourably taxed than income, say for example 50% in this instance. That means of the $100 capital gains you get taxed on $50 at your marginal tax rate. If your marginal tax rate was 20% you'd pay $10 in taxes. 

Property tax is usually for services and infrastructure, like fire services, roads etc. You can still get capital gains on property but that is separate from the property tax. Investment properties are treated similarly to other investments that appreciate in value.

The actually nitty gritty varies by country, but the basics are usually pretty consistent."
4142,2,MAML,"Put simply, to claim a tax deduction you must record an expense related to the charity donation. If you're donating an asset instead of an expense, you will have to be able to provide sufficient evidence you're claiming it at its fair market value. In this case, the IRS is far more likely to look at the 25k fee as deductible than the 20million ""appraised"" price if subjected to an audit, because the latter is completely unproven. 

Finally, even if the full 20m was somehow a deductible, there are limits to how much can be deducted and you would still be hit with a tax bill."

Trump-owned golf course offers a One million dollar prize for anybody that hits a hole in one. Guy hits a hole in one. Trump refuses to pay. Points to fine-print saying the shot has to go 150+ yards (and wouldn't you know it, the tee boxes on the par-3s are just short of that). Guy sues. Guy wins. Trump pays him. No wait, check that...the Trump Foundation pays ...not Trump's money, but money other people ""donated to charity."" Which was illegal, can't use a charity like that.

4172,2,MAML,"This wouldnt work. First, charitable donations deductions are limited to 50% of income. Second, IRS pub 561 outlines very specific rules for determining the value of art. If you paid an artist $25k for a painting and suddenly it was valued at 20 million, the IRS requires an explanation of the increase in value. And for donations of art over $50k, you need to pay the IRS a fee, and get an appraisal from a qualified appraiser that is approved by the IRS. Such an obvious fraud scheme would generate many flags for the IRS."
4173,2,MAML,"Not to mention, as soon as you sell an investment, you're taxed on the gains. So on taxes they would show a gain of millions an then a donation of it, breaking even.

Another was five or six 4' long fluorescent tube lights mounted together in a clump and lit-up, one of them flickering slightly.

One item was a rectangular piece of tan fabric with a single diagonal slash cut through the center, framed on the wall. It had its own wall.

Definitely helped that we had kind bud left over from Amsterdam. Nevertheless, I kept telling the GF to come into the other room and look at this shit, while I'm scratching my head giggling."

4191,2,MAML,Could this be similar to when they set up their own charity foundation and donate their money into it?
4192,2,MAML,I always thought it was a form of money laundering lol
4193,2,MAML,its not the artists. its the whole market around it all that is cancer. there is so amazing art being made and a lot of very expensive art looks great. but a painting for 20 million dollars is fucking bullshit. And it kinda makes me sad seeing that people are dismissing art just because it is expensive. its the corrupt galeries selling them and the pseudo cultural billionaires buying them.
4194,2,MAML,Most art these days is just a front for money-laundering and tax evasion.

The real scam is when the wealthy set up a fake charity and put their kids on the board.  They then write off the massive charitable donations to the charity and the charity pays his kids millions of dollars in salary as board members."

The wealthy make my life harder. The wealthy corrupt and abuse the system, at our expense. Not hipsters, not black people, not immigrants, not conservatives, not old people, not young people. The wealthy. They're my enemy. I'm not making any time for anything else."
4204,2,MAML,"This is accurate and not a conspiracy at all. I once met with an contemporary artist seeking help to make a market for his material.

He explained it like this : An Artist creates cache of work. Then, Art Dealer partners up with Artist to control his entire cache supply before it hits the market. Art Dealer calls his best 10 Collectors and sells each of them a piece of artwork for $100,000. (All of his Collectors are in on the scheme.)  So, his 10 Collectors each buy a $100,000 piece of contemporary artwork.  Now, the Art Dealer goes to an auction house with a fresh piece of work from the Artist's cache.  The auction begins at 100,000 and people start calling in. Who calls in? The ""10 Collectors"" who already own the artwork by the same artist.  They all bid up the auction from $100,000 to $1,000,000.  Now guess what? Those ""10 Collectors"" just 10x'd their original $100,000 piece of artwork into $1,000,000.

Now that the auction house has established a formal market for the pricing of the Artist's work, the Art Dealer openly sells more artwork to foreign investors (Chinese, Russian, etc) for $1,000,000 because the auction established it there. The Art Dealer's job is to make sure the pricing stays high and controls supply and demand.  Many people who buy art at $1,000,000 use it as a way to park their money.

In fact, often artwork sits in a FreePort ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva\_Freeport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Freeport) ) and doesnt even hang on a wall.

Anyway, you get the picture now. Don't read into contemporary art too much.  Its a lot of bs."
4205,2,MAML,"Your comment is true except for the first sentence. The OP is false. What you said is true.

You can't commission art for $20 then write it off for more than that $20 cost basis when the value goes up. You can only write off your cost basis. So the entire OP is invalid.

You can also only write off up to half your income for that year I'm taxes. So the most the millionaire could write off is 10 million, not 20 million.

4218,2,MAML,"&gt; and good for all of them fuck the irs 

No, it is terrible for the economy. You might think ""fuck the IRS"" because it fucks you, but that is just because we need to change the tax law, consider things like negative income tax for lowest earns (another form of UBI), but when billionaires aren't paying taxes, that means they don't spend that money like a poor person would, they stash that money and it doesn't circulate in the economy as well as it would if the billionaire paid the taxes, and then the tax money went to programs that show to have positive effects on the economy. It's just a) the tax code currently fucks poor people so hence probably why you say ""fuck the IRS"", and b) the government is **currently** corrupted by the fact money is considered speech and they take big lobby cash so it seems like money going to the government isn't going to proper places (such as billion dollar increase in war budget), but that goes hand in hand why we cannot have ultra wealthy people not pay taxes because then they have more money to give to politicians etc., so need to fix the tax code and fix the political campaign system"
4219,2,MAML,"""cheats"" ...you mean follow the letter of the law."
4220,2,MAML,"Taxes serve plenty of purposes too. Education is ridiculously expensive, and putting children through a decade and a half of school costs a huge amount. As do roads, emergency services, healthcare (I realise some healthcare systems are private, but even then there's still a massive amount of coverage provided by programs such as medicaid, and private systems are way more expensive anyway), mental health services, addiction services, broadband coverage, armed forces, regulations etc. I know there is plenty of waste, but I think taxes are generally a good thing."

Very easy to move and hide resources or buy a painting as payment /bribe for something else and no one can do or say anything about it. Much like book deals for politicians - no one read or bought obama books, but lots of pulped paper and ""official numbers"" for sales as obama gets post presidential payoff."

Cia USED modern art scene? Now I can buy that"
4232,2,MAML,I used to do trade work at former Goldman Sachs president estate. The amount of stupid art he had was ridiculous.  Me and the other techs used to joke that  this is art when it looked like a baby smeared his dirty diaper on canvas.
4233,2,MAML," &gt; ""In effect, what modernism in the arts represents is the collapse into complete solipsism and nihilism. As Barnhisel aptly puts it, one modernist understood modernism as 'self-referentiality' to such an extent that its products could be viewed as 'self-contained artifacts whose meaning was not dependent upon social context, the biography of the artist, or the reception of the reader or perceiver.' In effect, **it is a complete divorce from all culture, that is, from all that is humanizing and psychologically integrative.** Indeed, such extreme self-referentiality, if translated from the cultural to the clinical contexts, would be considered dissociative and sociopathic. By promoting it, the American intelligence community in effect not made modernism the intelligence community's, and America's and the West's, 'chosen' and 'imperial art', the preferred vehicle to present its bourgeois 'liberal values', but also introduced a form of art that *drove* dissociative and sociopathic pathologies into general culture.

 &gt; As such, modernism also became not just America's 'imperial art,"" it became the 'establishment.' If one bemoans the all-pervasive influence of modernism in America's graduate art, literature, or music departments, this is why. It could 'mean' anything, or nothing at all, but in either case there was no *Affekt* in any traditional sense. For example, for Nelson Rockefeller and the Rockefellers in general, modernism in art represented 'free enterprise,' and capitalism, its chief efforts were not inspiration in the artist or perceiver, but, because of its rejection of all tradition and emphasis on self-referentiality, its chief inspiration and effect was revulsion, and a kind of opposition for opposition's sake, and shock.""

4235,2,MAML,"Man what horse shit. It's impossible to divorce art from cultural context, premodern or not."
4236,2,MAML,"Modern Art does not and cannot exist outside the historical trajectory of Western modes of Art production. Therefore it is impossible to divorce from the culture from which it is born. Moreover, all ""meaning"" is derived from social context. It's completely bound to it.

Farrell can't escape it himself. At once he is trying to say that it's divorced from culture, and in the next breadth he's saying its dissociative and sociopathic, and because of that it was promoted into imperial art? His argument is illogical; total nonsense.

""As such"" Farrell removes the historical and cultural contexts of Modern Art production by saying that it has none, an argument that can only be made out sheer and total ignorance of Modern Art, and in that vacuum he places some crackpot theory about how what modern art really means is what the state and the oligarch decide. In effect, he cucks himself.

4240,2,MAML,Who cares. We shouldn't be stolen from via taxes to begin with.
4241,2,MAML,Not all art donated to museums is beyond your appreciation. There are a lot of really good art donated. Giving a tax write off to the donor truly benefits museums.
4242,2,MAML,"I know it seems like money laundering must be the reason for overpriced terrible art, but the art world is more complex than that. Galleries show this kind of work as a way to signal that their offerings are exclusive. THEY are trying to keep YOU the hell away from THEM. Regular people like beautiful artwork. But they are not regular people, they are elites. They are people for whom $100k is to them like a hundred bucks is to you. It's not meaningful how much they spend, only that it is more than you could ever afford. They distance themselves from you when they spend life-changing money on garbage art. They are signaling their contempt for mundane values. They are signaling that they are the people who understand this kind of work (whether they do or not) and you are not. They have no idea we're laughing at them and frankly they don't care. In the case of this banana art, it was a memento that inspired the artist, an avant-garde sculptor. He hung it on his wall as inspiration to be more amusing with his work. It should never have left his studio wall. He had no business showing it for sale in Miami but the gallery owner agreed to do it and I'll bet they thought something just like this would happen. And they love that we're outraged."
4243,2,MAML,"Even if you could manage this, you could only itemize the contribution for 30% of your AGI maximum per year.  Still could be worth it, but it would never directly result in paying *no* taxes.

But dont get me wrong, problems like this [do exist.](https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-irs2mar02-story.html)"
4244,2,MAML,More like money laundering
4245,2,MAML,Nah I don't think 90% is tax evasion. A big part of that is money laundering too.
4246,2,MAML,Ive been saying the same thing for years but with the artist being a criminal in some way. Say I wanna sell you drugs and you wanna buy them from me... I simply make some crap art that you buy from me for the amount the drugs were gonna cost you... then you walk away with some piece of art you may be able to sell to some moron as well as all the drugs I just sold you and I get to put that money directly into the bank because it looks like I sell art and not drugs.
4247,2,MAML,"Not how deductions work, there are caps on donation writeoffs, but that's just details."
4248,2,MAML,"Math is off,but you've got a general sense of what is going on."

4251,2,MAML,The tax write off is the lower of cost or market.  The appraisal is required when donated property has a cost and value of more than 5k.  It is shit like this that makes people stupid.

4260,2,MAML,"It's not just the art world. It happens in all intellectual property and intangibles. This is why the mob has always been involved in the music business, Hollywood, and more recently the software development game. You really think it costs a billion dollars to create a marvel movie? Is there anyway for authorities to verify whether the top act on a record label sold 1 million copies of their album, or how many streams their single had online, or how many tickets on their tour? All those numbers are easily inflatable. Then there is the enterprise software racket. Copy pasta some open source code of some generic database or CRM type software, then sell licenses for 60k a pop that expire every year. Rinse repeat."
4261,2,MAML,"If the millionaire purchased a piece from the artist for 25k, then had the work appraised for $20M, then the appraiser would most definitely lose their license. As an art appraiser, you MUST be unbiased in your valuation of the work, accounting for many different variables. And, appraisal value doesnt always equate to the value you would receive on a tax write off. 

Also, museums wont accept any random piece of artwork just for the sake of housing artwork. They have limited space, works must be voted on by a panel and usually they are looking for works/artists which have significant context from an art historical perspective, which to the average person you just wouldnt understand.

Im not saying that millionaires dont abuse their wealth by purchasing art to gain more favorable tax incentives, because they do. Its just not as simple as how this post makes it seem, and I dont want the conspiracy nuts to start burning artwork or not supporting museums for the sake of spiting the rich...

4269,2,MAML,"I 100% agree with this, its the only thing that makes modern art make sense.
I once had an art teacher who argued with the entire class over a blue canvas. That's all it was, a blue fucking canvas.
He argued with anyone who told him its not art, he would say ""art is subjective, there is nothing you can say is not art if you are told it is.""
My silent response was always ""if that were true then you're essentially saying your job is fucking pointless.""

I hated that guy. Spent the first half of every class talking politics and the next half yelling about how everything is art."

4273,2,MAML,"After seeing [this red square] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Square_%28painting%29?wprov=sfla1) hanging in the MOMA, I never felt like going back there. Most other museums I'd go to gladly, but I actually want to be inspired by what I see there, so MOMA is not for me."
4274,2,MAML,Seeing that legitimately makes me angry. That's incredibly frustrating to look at.
4275,2,MAML,"Aside from the economic aspect. The cultural and historical significance of modern art is also no coincidence. 

""Art in Weimar experienced a similar descent into meaningless, perverse works that inspired nothing but sadness and discord. ""Dadaism"" &amp; ""Cubism"" were all the rage. The Elites promoted this as ""intellectual"" and modern. Sound familiar? Painters like Hanns Ludwig Katz did well.""

4276,2,MAML,Tax write-offs don't work like that.
4277,2,MAML,Been looking a long time for a single comment to point this out. You can't write it off unless that's the actual valuation. If that's the actual valuation then you would have to pay taxes on the gains(if liquidated). So for this post you would be assessed for 40 million and write 20 million off and still have to pay taxes on the original 20 million.
4278,2,MAML,"Hello, artist here (and not a hipster one). 

1) are you talking about contemporary art or modern art? Words mean stuff and junk.

2) when you are speaking about bullshit art like a line on a canvas, are you assuming that there was no intent/idea/inspiration behind that line on the canvas? 

3) who is guilty in this scheme? The purchaser of the art? The artist? The appraiser? The gallery? The museum? All of them? Lots of moving parts here, and I think it would be wise to better define your terms. 

4) I would like to know your knowledge of art history. Modern art vs. contemporary art. What led to the current trends in contemporary art, etc. It's easy to say a banana taped to a wall is shit art. It's also very easy to look at a nice painting of a sunset and say it's art. Neither of which may be true. 

5) in conclusion, while it may be true that the art market is a way to move wealth around, evade taxes, what have you, it is also true that the vast majority of the American public indeed does not allow themselves to access most contemporary art until an art historian tells them it's art. Example, the banana. Once you open yourself up to the idea that art can be more than a nice painting of a sunset, you may find you actually appreciate things like a streak on a canvas."
4279,2,MAML,I'm convinced there is no way to ask these sort of questions and not come off as pretentious.
4280,2,MAML,"Professional artist here, can confirm 100% true. Additionally billionaires have high value work as bragging rights the way plebs collect... anything... magic cards come to mind. I was at a family gathering and my late aunts fiance was a founder of a major computer brand, in one of his offices at a 20+ mil house he had thomas hill paintings that dwarfed walls. His rumpus room was full of kandinskys... and he didnt even live there. It was unreal. Turns out He had to spend 2.5 million a month to evade taxes on his wealth and he still came out ahead.

Edit: also dont forget to notice the insurance game played on art. Inevitably real items get damaged or age. However the return on investment is guaranteed via insurance."
4281,2,MAML,"This is BS by someone who doesnt understand accounting. Im not even an accountant and it seems silly.

If you have lump of meme you bought for £1.00, and due to the crazy meme economy its value increases to £1,000,000 you owe no tax as you havent actualised that gain. But when you finally sell it for £1M, you will need to pay capital gains tax on £999,999 of %19. If you were to give it away instead you pay no tax but you get no tax writeoff (well ok, £1 writeoff) as you never lost anything.

There are easier ways to avoid tax that are commonly used and involved less BS.

For money laundering this would make sense though."
4282,2,MAML,100% of taxes is just legalized theft.
4283,2,MAML,"yup get like me I pave my own roads and do my own national defense

check it out on r/diynationstate"
4284,2,MAML,imagine thinking that roads only exist because of the IRS.
4285,2,MAML,"Because you're forced to.


Try not paying your taxes and starting a private police force.


""Public services"" are horrifically corrupt and siphoned off. Non government entities could provide better services for cheaper. This is econ 101. Competition is good for the consumer. The government does NOT want competition."
4286,2,MAML,Roads? Libraries? What are you some kinda commie?!
4287,2,MAML,"Damn, I've been found"
4288,2,MAML,"Imagine actually believing the Federal Reserve and IRS are legitimate institutions on a conspiracy message board.

You're not from around these parts, are you?"
4289,2,MAML,"No, please explain how before the creation of the IRS and Federal Reserve this country was a barren wasteland. No roads, trains, libraries, prisons, hospitals. None of that existed before the IRS started shaking down people."
4290,2,MAML,"The US relied almost exclusively on import tariffs before the IRS, until income tax was introduced about a hundred years ago. Since then the quality and volume of your aforementioned roads/trains/libraries/prisons/hospitals/etc has increased dramatically."
4291,2,MAML,"I do actually believe this.  And all those ""services"" would exist without taxes, AND they would be profitable and contribute to the economy instead of suck from it."
4292,2,MAML,"And see how that's working out. Rest of California burns while private companies protect Kim Kardashian.

God forbid that happens in the city.

You forget that California is very capitalistic. Private electricity and private fire fighters. And they're on fire.

Australia reduced their fire budget and they're pretty much fucked."
4293,2,MAML,road developers and tolls.  next?
4294,2,MAML,"No one would build rural/remote roads if their only motive was profit from tolls. Sure, if there's a mine there then Exxon will build a road and make it private. But if there's a village or township with a population of 20 over like 100 square miles - no one would bother putting a road down. Investing $100 million to collect $10 a day - that's a real moneymaker! The corporations will get right on that.

No one built roads for the little people until the modern state arose. Until then there were only the roads for trade and military use connecting the largest cities only."
4295,2,MAML,Glad there's some sense of normal thought here
4296,2,MAML,"That's actually a great idea. Let's have the government stop maintaining all rural roads and privatize power and internet in those areas. Themn they would have no roads or electricity and social media would magically stop being a shit show.

Let those Hicks try living off the land or fairly paying for what they use. The Republican party would be destroyed also since none of them would be able to get to a voting station."
4297,2,MAML,"&gt;Seems like you're paying so why not just pay taxes? 


Consent. I don't consent to slaughtering innocent people in the middle east. I don't consent to funding corrupt police forces. I don't consent to oil subsidies. 


Why not choose how to spend your own money?"
4298,2,MAML,this is a fair point and I agree. But isn't your issue with democracy then and not taxes? I don't consent with my money being used in those ways either but the people have chosen the government to spend the money that way.
4299,2,MAML,"Yes! I appreciate you following the logic, many folks write off the philosophy without understanding. 


Large scale democracy is immoral. There no reason people in Alabama should be voting on laws and rulers for people in California. 


The only moral route is for every US state to secede. Dissolve the entire federal government. From there I'd say states should further dissolve into smaller local organization, but that's their call."

4304,2,MAML,"I was in a modern art museum in high school.  I walked into a string hanging from the ceiling.  Thought it was a cobweb or something at first.  Pulled on it and the security came running over telling me not to touch the display.  Oh, my bad.  I didn't know a fucking piece of string hanging from the ceiling counted as artwork.  If that's the case then the finger painting I did in preschool belongs in the library of Alexandria.  

&amp;#x200B;

Glad someone in line at the museum told me that you don't actually have to pay $40 to get in, its just the ""suggested donation,"" though the sign doesn't say that.  I told the lady I only have 15 cents, and she rolled her eyes and took my 15 cents and gave me the ticket.  Turns out that was the biggest waste of 15 cents of my life."
4305,2,MAML,"Art has always been a scam. That being said, I've seen a painting that acctualy felt like it spoke to me, couldn't stop staring and it was just a bunch of colors. I felt like I would have paid anything to have it but it was owned by a museum here in Sweden."
4306,2,MAML,"This isn't how it works at all.

They would end up paying about $2m more in taxes if they ""Got away with it."""
4307,2,MAML,"Except thats not how it works at all. 

According to the IRS  collectors may deduct the lesser of cost basis or fair market value up to 50% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) and carry the deduction forward for up to five years.

So they only get to deduct from their income what they paid. But that doesnt fit the narrative."

4313,2,MAML,"While some people thinks this means modern art is stupid, it's really just the tax code that is stupid. Get rid of certain tax write offs, increase capital gains tax, consider a negative income tax (or UBI as some call it) for lowest income earns, and have a much steeper progressive income tax law, closer to what it was in U.S. when we were booming closer to WWII"
4314,2,MAML,"Hahah. Its hard to be mad
At this though"
4315,2,MAML,"Its Friday and I feel a little slow but Im not understanding what the scam is here?

Like, the millionaire in this scenario still had to pay $25M just to declare $20M, right? So not only are they losing $5M but theyre still paying out the $20M they would have had to pay to the government, correct? So whats the benefit?

Is it something like if you have enough write offs it changes your tax bracket? Or is it just about if youre gonna spend this money anyway youd rather look like a big shot because of your museum donations?"
4316,2,MAML,"The idea here is that the millionaire paid $25K but got a $20M deduction. Assuming it all came off the highest tax bracket in the US (37%), that's roughly $9.25M in tax savings for only spending $25K. 

What OP doesn't realize is that you can only deduct the lesser of basis ($25K) or FMV ($20M). So even if this did happen, the millionaire could only deduct $25K, or what he paid for it."
4317,2,MAML,"No, you pay a ""small"" amount for the art, get it evaluated at 20M (it doesn't receive capital gains tax cuz you never sell it) then donate it. You never pay the 20M."
4318,2,MAML,"Ok, this makes more sense. So the key is the evaluation for the payoff."
4319,2,MAML,Fuck off with that title
4320,2,MAML,Now it all makes sense
4321,2,MAML,It's also a way of money laundering. You pay cash under the table. Then get it appraised. Then the cash is clean when you sell it.

4347,2,MAML,"ok well what i meant is that it is used for money laundering, not necessarilly related to tax evasion"

4349,2,MAML,Where can I get a job as one of these artists?
4350,2,MAML,"Okay, but where does the museum get that $20M? It's basically a scheme to get museums to pay your taxes, and I don't get why museums go along with it."
4351,2,MAML,The most unrealistic part of this is that they paid the artist instead of coercing them to work for exposure haha

4397,2,WTC,"&gt; all the phone calls (that the video confirms that there were calls) were made from a tarmac while the passengers were held hostage by the government.

So the government is willing to kill thousands of people that are occupying the tower, but for some reason they aren't willing to kill the couple hundred that would be on the flight?"
4398,2,WTC,"I think he meant, if you've got technology to remote-control a plane into a tower, why take the passengers off and kill them later when you could just leave them on the plane and have them die in the crash?  That seems like an unnecessary step, especially since who knows how many dozens of airport workers might see it or report it. "

""The CIA has been developing plans to covert operations that involve the in-flight swapping of commercial airlines with military drones SINCE the '60s.""

Doesnt mean that the technology is they used in 2001 was from the 60s, they sure improved the technology, and I think the connection used was satellite-based.
"
4400,2,WTC,"The question is why do it? If you already have a plane that you are going to need to eliminate anyways? The extra complication would be pretty immense.

4401,2,WTC,"Well there have been multiple veteran pilots who say what they did should be next to impossible for amateur pilots who had only trained on small planes, so the remote control aspect makes sense to make sure the job gets done properly.

4407,2,WTC,It doesn't really sound logical that anyone could hijack a plane armed with plastic cutlery either.
4408,2,WTC,"And Donald Trump banned travel from foreign countries, but not Saudi Arabia."

4411,2,WTC,"You make it sound like there was a failure and they came down,  not being hit by a massive missile "
4412,2,WTC,"Massive? It would take approximately 50 of those airliners to outweigh the Eiffel Tower. Each of the Twin Towers weighed as much as 50 Eiffel Towers.

The Prudential building in Warsaw, at only eighteen stories, was hit by approximately 1,000 artillery shells during World War II. Guess what? It's still standing! "
4413,2,WTC,"Are you trying to make some case that to make a building topple you would need to hit it with something of equal weight, no matter where or how you hit it?

You make it sound like a taller building should be stronger. You are also looking at a massive survivor bias, plenty of buildings collapsed during WW II. There is a ton of variation even then, the buildings of Stalingrad tended to react to explosives very differnt then the ones in Berlin, and certainly different the ones in Japan."
4414,2,WTC,"Planes may not be the heaviest, but they sure do fly fast."
4415,2,WTC,"The Prudential building was built with concrete and brick making it much more structurally sound than the WTC. Being shorter would decrease the probability of collapse, not increase it. In what world does the number of stories increase the stability of a building? The WTC's would sway in the wind because they were so tall and relatively lightweight. They were literally made of steel beams, glass, and plaster. 

Your point about the weight of the Eiffel Towers is incredibly irrelevant too. There are dozens of other variables that come in to play beyond the weight of the structure and the missile hitting it. 

I usually just come here to read but the stupidity of your post actually made me sign in and comment. I have never encountered such horrible logical reasoning. Congratulations. "

Either way it would be a world record so this ""proof"" is at best cancelled out. All those much smaller demolitions took a ton more time than 36 hours to wire much smaller buildings, and didn't have to worry about timing it with Jets, or worry about any kind of connection cut off by a jet hitting it."
4418,2,WTC,"Witnesses did spot unusual traffic at night weeks before WTC hit the ground.

I don't have the source at hand atm, but it is on a video somewhere; white unmarked vans driving shuttle-traffic between 11pm &amp; 5am between august and september 2001. 

I'd also like to remind you that G. W. Bush's brother was managing security at WTC in that period."
4419,2,WTC,"&gt; coincidences

Oh I know! Coincidences like 3 steel framed buildings collapsing due to fire which is a first in skyscraper history! Or passports surviving impacts of a building, the hard ground and fireballs while the black boxes are destroyed! Coincidences like a green pilot making a 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corkscrew turn to impact exactly where DoD staffers were working on a missing 2.3 trillion dollars! Don't forget the coincidence of the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening! Oh what about the coincidence of the BBC reporting the WTC 7 collapsing 23 minutes before it actually happen! Oh boy there's a lot more too!

"
4438,2,WTC,"I don't get it, what's the implication? That the BBC was also in on the act? Also the reporters and everyone else involved with that information. Why widen the conspiracy? It makes it less plausible that it was all kept secret."
4439,2,WTC,"The ""implication"" is that BBC was told that the building collapsed and they dutifully reported the info. The timing of the ""announcement"" was off. "
4440,2,WTC,It's because the interior frame of the structure *had* collapsed about an hour earlier. What you actually saw collapsing was just the skin of the building.

4443,2,WTC,"I'm finding it a bit odd that the core of the building (that's meant to be the strong bit) collapsed and the outer shell didn't. That doesn't seem particularly logical to me. 

I'm not an engineer but I'd have thought that the inner core would be far more resilient than the bit outside (especially when the official explanation is that the building collapsed due to the amount of debris that hit it)."

you should be a gymnast, a logical one

i bet you think babies come from storks"
4450,2,WTC,Everybody up-voting you because your made up factoid supports the official narrative but this is just flat out not true.
4451,2,WTC,This is pure conjecture.
4452,2,WTC,This is fucking bullshit and from vantage there was no way to tell the building was falling on the inside. 
4453,2,WTC,But why would anyone need to tell the BBC what to report? Surely they would just see that is had collapsed and report it.  
4454,2,WTC,Reporters are constantly fed what to say through ear pieces by producers and higher ups.
4455,2,WTC,The news services are routinely told what to report by the CIA. see Book 'Journalists for Hire' by Udo Ulfkottie. Recently deceased.
4456,2,WTC,"I'm skeptical that the CIA control the BBC - as British company. But in addition to that, why would the CIA need to feed the information to the BBC? Why wouldn't they just let them report on the building falling down when they saw it live? Makes no sense to risk feeding news corporations information and creating a chain, when they will see it themselves with their own eyes."
4457,2,WTC,"Because mainstream news sources receive their script of what to say from a higher authority like News Corp.  The different news stations and channels are an illusion of diverse viewpoints.  They are told what to say by the power structure above them.  Investigative honesty is out there, but it's getting more and more watered down by [scripted journalism](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jH8dejYGa5A)."
4458,2,WTC,"You know there's a difference between reporters and journalists, they just repeated what they were told to report, presumably by a source they trusted."
4459,2,WTC,"I feel like news wasn't ""in on it"", just trying to be the first to broadcast it.  You can hear firefighters and cops claiming the buildings were going to ""blow up"", and come down before it ever fell as well."
4460,2,WTC,"If the authorities told the BBC that the building had collapsed because it was scheduled to collapse at that time but they never bothered to actually glance over and check whether or not it was still standing, they probably weren't smart enough to plan a massive conspiracy. "
4461,2,WTC,"That's what I don't get about all the theories. Why the fuck are so many people in on the conspiracy, yet nobody has blown the whistle?"
4462,2,WTC,"My thoughts exactly, if basically your average journalist is somehow involved in 9/11, how many other conspiracies are there which your average joe knows about, they would be revealed all the time if this was true"
4463,2,WTC,"[Watch this until 4:44 for a possible explanation.](https://youtu.be/8DOnAn_PX6M?t=4h41m34s)

Watch the whole documentary if you care to be informed on 9/11."
4464,2,WTC,What's the actual theory here though? The BBC were in on it? I mean it's weird but I don't see it supporting the inside job theory at all. 
4465,2,WTC,"They were fed the ""news"" before it happened."
4466,2,WTC,"Why would any conspirators want to feed that news though? It was going to happen so obviously it would get reported on. I'm not an anti-truther, I just think that this particular aspect doesn't make much sense"
4467,2,WTC,Also the owner of the building getting an insurance for terrorist attacks just 2 weeks before the attack and then not being in the building during a weekday for the 1st time in many years.  I still dont know what to believe but there sure is a shitload of eye browsing raising parts to it.
4468,2,WTC,There was a large number of absences that day. 
4469,2,WTC,"The list goes on and on. Literally for days. People don't even want to acknowledge that we have conducted false flag operations in the past. I think the notion of the Government willingly participating in murdering its own citizens, or allowing it to happen, is to much for people to wrap their heads around. What people don't understand that should be clear by now, is that the Government isn't ""one group"" of people working towards goals. It's several groups fighting for power and money. Many of which, would have zero problem killing to protect what they have. "
4470,2,WTC,"&gt;What people don't understand that should be clear by now, is that the Government isn't ""one group"" of people working towards goals. It's several groups fighting for power and money.

I agree with this. Many people think it's just one monolithic conspiracy group but in fact there's many different cliques to the conspiracy."
4471,2,WTC,True. People don't believe their government is capable of killing. That it is a third world problem not a so-called first world thing.
4472,2,WTC,"This has always bugged me.

I was in high school when this happened and we had the news on all day.  I very distinctly remember the news channel we were watching report that WTC 7 had been weekend and it was going to fall so they evacuated it and were going to demolish it.  They even used the term ""pull it"" on the broadcast and explained what it meant.  I only remember them talking about that once, but I remember it.

I know i didn't hallucinate this.  I never really thought much of it though until I saw conspiracy theories revolving around the BBC report.  At first I just chalked it up to BBC getting their info wrong, they were told the building was being pulled but reported it as falling on its own.  Which is why they had the info so early.

It fucks with me so much because I very distinctly remember that shit, but I've never seen anyone else bring it up."
4473,2,WTC,I was 26 when 9/11 happened and I watched it on tv. I can't remember the details but I think I remember it being said on the news on the day it happened that building 7 was brought down intentionally due to damage.
4474,2,WTC,"I love the bit about the passports being found in the rubble. Yeah, fucking right. A fire hot enough that it was still burning under the rubble days later and somehow the passports just happened to fall out of that. 

I am genuinely confused as to why anyone believes that part of the official events."
4475,2,WTC,"I applaud you,  anyone who respects science understands the official report is garbage.  These same people probably didn't even read the graphic novel of the report. Lol"
4476,2,WTC,"That is a really interesting list on the blog. 

One thing I'd like to point out is that I have trouble buying into a VT school false flag to cover up the fact that the French warned about an upcoming attack AND have this be a massive, one plane, government operated conspiracy. Either terrorists did this and a
France warned something was brewing or it was an inside job. 

Another thing I never see in relation to WTC 7 is that the networks said all afternoon that WTC 7 was about to collapse. It was not a surprise, there was plenty of warning and iirc it wasn't broadcast several times that a wtc7 collapse was coming. Airchecks from ABC around 45 minute she or so befor WTC 7 collapsed could prove me right or wrong. There may have even been discussion about it being intentionally brought down. "
4477,2,WTC,"A single coincidence is one thing...
but dozens?"
4478,2,WTC,"I like the one about the scheduled military/air force exercises for that day

I think it's fucking idiotic to dismiss outlandish ideas right away in a world that has proven to be shaped and controlled by forces that lie beyond our direct line of sight. Yes, a lot of conspiracy theories are silly, but it is important to entertain ideas without immediately accepting/dismissing them.

4490,2,WTC,"I'm far from a ""9/11 was an inside job"" conspiracy theorist. However, my fiancee's uncle worked in some sort of administrative department at the Pentagon. His supervisor was one of those guys that never took a sick day or left the office early for like 25 years.

The Monday night before 9/11 this guy's boss called him and said he wouldn't be in the next day and mentioned that it was alright if my fiancee's uncle wanted to come in a little later than usual. He could have just been embellishing when he told the story, but he always mentions how his supervisor didn't sound ""right"" over the phone. My fiancee's uncle decided that if his supervisor wasn't going to be there, he might as well set his alarm a little later, spend the morning with his wife and then head to work in the afternoon.

Then 9/11 happened. I have no idea if my fiancee's uncle would have died or gotten hurt or if his supervisor had some sort of information that no one else had. It's just a very bizarre story."

4510,2,WTC,"I posted this a while ago... it seems relevant now:

&gt;Yeah right. I don't deal in fucking conspiracy theory I deal in fact.

&gt;In theory bombs were in the towers.

&gt;In theory the planes were remote controlled.

&gt;In theory the object that hit the pentagon was a missile.

&gt;In theory WTC 7 was brought down with explosives.

&gt;And you know what? I don't give a fucking SHIT about any of that. Because it does nothing and only serves to further drive away people from the possibility of reasoned, rational discussion about what we do know and instead encourages everyone to talk about bullshit that they do not know.

&gt;You may BELIEVE. You may SUSPECT. You must THEORISE that these things happened, but you do not KNOW. If you set out to demonstrate to the world that these theories are fact - you damage your credibility and you damage the credibility of anyone who tries to broach the subject of false flag attacks and you are just as much a threat to the truth as those who seek to subvert it purposely.

&gt;It isn't a theory that General Mahmood Ahmed was having breakfast with the house intelligence committee on the morning of 911. The same general Mahmood Ahmed of the Pakistani ISI that wired 100,000 dollars to the lead hijacker.

&gt;It isn't a theory that multiple foreign intelligence services warned the United States that the attacks were coming.

&gt;It isn't theory that local intelligence agencies including the CIA warned the president the attacks were coming AND briefed him on it.

&gt;It isn't a theory that the precursor to the NSA surveillance program, ECHELON picked up the attacks well before they happened and the information was ignored.

&gt;It isn't a theory that the FBI had an informant that was, at one time, living with one of the hijackers.

&gt;It isn't a theory that the stand down orders were changed before 911.

&gt;It isn't a theory that a congressman testified that Cheney was aware of the plane coming into the Pentagon and was tracking it.

&gt;It isn't a theory that prominent members of the Bush administration chaired a think tank group that exactly one year before the attacks - published a paper suggesting that America's military must be upgraded and that the only way to get the American people to agree is for their to be a major attack.

&gt;There are a catalog of NON-THEORY events that indicate what we all fear happened and that's just 911.

&gt;I'm not a fucking conspiracy theorist. I don't take pleasure in finding out how utterly, disturbingly fucked up my government is. I don't enjoy being right when right means that millions of people are dead because of people that represent us around the world.

&gt;I do not consider myself to be 'awake' and I do not consider myself a member of some fraternity with a secret fucking handshake.

&gt;But no JET FUEL DON'T MELT STEEL BEAMS MMMKK!!!"
4511,2,WTC,"I like your facts versus theory/conjecture/wild speculation approach but one but I'd refer to here is the NSA one. The system they were using was called TRAILBLAZER and it was a bulk collection system. The problem was they were hoovering up everything and the analysts couldn't cope.

William Binney left the NSA in disgust because when they reviewed TRAILBLAZER's take a few months after 9/11 they found they had enough information to stop the attacks. In his view they could have and should have.  Binney went on to be a whistleblower and is a staunch proponent of targeted surveillance and a staunch opponent of bulk surveillance.

I'm not knowledgeable enough on the other points but I like the cut of your jib.
"
4512,2,WTC,"I said ECHELON specifically which was a precursor to programs LIKE Trailblazer.

ECHELON, and the systems that operated under that name existed in some form or another since the 50's. 

It to was a bulk collection system, but BEFORE the 911 chatter was even passed on for analysis the system itself had already indicated specifically what the danger was. When you combine this with the CIA's intelligence, forign intelligence and the briefings the Bush administration was recieving and the fact that the Bush administration wanted an attack - something was going on. This isn't simply a case of ""They always get so much information it's hard to act on any one thing"".... they had MANY corroborating sources all near the same time indicating an attack was imminent and these warnings were ignored.

Besides just this specific example of intelligence being ignored you combine that with the other indicators and you have more than enough to build a case - and that's what should be the focus.

"
4513,2,WTC,"While I agree with the main point of your post,  I wonder how you could possibly know whether what you said are facts,  are indeed true.

Not saying you're wrong,  but it's questionable whether your arrangement of labels are completely accurate. "
4514,2,WTC,The only credible 911 theories should be around the Govt manipulating actual would be terrorists or merely letting them act for political purpose.
4515,2,WTC,"Anyone else remember the unscheduled ""Fire safety maintenance"" that took place 1 week before before 911 in the towers with construction taking place on the SAME floor as the planes crashed, I remember someone said it quite quickly afterward, around the same time that the head architect proclaimed far and wide on the deafest of ears that the towers where specifically designed to withstand planes being flown into them. Most skycrapers are. Anyway he was quickly shut up, and i couldnt find out anymore through the news. Does anyone else remember? Also Americans might not be aware.that in the uk the BBC was reporting for 28 mins BEFORE the towers went down that they had already collapsed! When I heard ""This iconic landscape will forever be changed due to the collapse of theses two buildings"" it made me think WTF I'm no expert on the NYC skyline, but could do you mean those two buildings with planes hanging out of them? And then 28 mins later a controlled demolition took place. The video is still Watchable on the BBC website.  This looks to be no longer true, but we all know the BBC aren't above RE Recording the news with different wording to fit the narrative( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JtivadbNrXk ). Most of what they showed is still easily available on youtube, but the interviews with witnesses/experts were live, so are anyone's guess, hence the question ""does anyone else remember seeing them""Edit.sorry I cant always post workable links easily on phone.Edit. Ok sorry guys I got a bit wrong/misremembered, she does say WTC 7, it was scrolled writing that said twin towers."
4516,2,WTC,"I don't remember the construction part, but do remember that the towers were built with a special infrastructure to withstand planes hitting them. I even saw pictures of the original diagrams and there was special reinforcements everywhere in those buildings. 

I did however see the video you're talking about many years ago... there was a guy who built a web-site - it was like 20 pages or something, and he had a copy of the original BBC news report on there. That site dissapeared a long time ago. 

But I also remember interviews where people were saying there was white powder all over the heating/ventilation things in the weeks prior. There were pictures - they were like up against the walls I think.

Also Bush Jr.'s brother did security for the WTC.

4517,2,WTC,ITT: /r/all vs /r/conspiracy
4518,2,WTC,"True, /r/conspiracy came by in the first or 2 first hours of the post, then it became this."
4519,2,WTC,A 9/11 conspiracy on r/all? Thats something I haven't seen in a long time. Wondering when will americans admit that there were a lot of shady shit around 9/11.
4520,2,WTC,"PATRIOT ACT was written by our good buddy Joey Biden, in 1995!! 

Yeehaw!!

There was a lot of chatter prior to 9/11 about an attack coming.

There was an Israeli instant messaging service with documented messages telling people to avoid WTC on 9/11.

How about the war games that simulated terrorists high-jacking airliners, THAT VERY SAME MORNING?

I think we can all agree the official story is BS.

I also suggest looking into the Project for a New American Century, and its plans, that required a ""new Pearl Harbor"" to initiate. 

I've read quite a few books from many different angles on 9/11, and this thread makes me want to read more."
4521,2,WTC,Skipped lunch? Last time I checked people don't eat lunch at 9:30 AM
4522,2,WTC,I would skip lunch in the cafeteria also if my office building just fell down. 
4523,2,WTC,Gotta have lunch that early if you want to get to Cracker Barrel by 3 for dinner.
4524,2,WTC,"Old people do, especially when they have breakfast at 5am"
4525,2,WTC,For super rich power dudes that get up at 4:30AM its right in their wheelhouse. Especially when they leave at 1.
4526,2,WTC,Nor do they go for a walk 30 minutes - 1.5 hours after they got to the office.
4527,2,WTC,"**USUALLY** 

Emphasis mine"
4528,2,WTC,"For me it's the way the towers fell down in a perfect controlled demolition manner, you can find videos of failed demolitions where buildings fall to their sides or not entirely, which is what you might expect from a plane crash, but apparently airplane fuel melts steel bars in a way that the buildings fall inward breaking the concrete core as well.

Also what about the other buildings that were perfectly demolished without being hit? What is the patriotic explanation for that?"
4529,2,WTC,"WT7 had a lot of financially-related documents and SS/CIA documents. There was going to be a financial investigation into a financial black hole of funding, but then the building was torched. 
And there was a lot of good info on the pentagon strike during the early-2000s - but a lot of the info got whitewashed from the internet. 
Also, the bombs in the GW bridge. And the white van. 
"
4530,2,WTC,"What about the people that were meant to be on the planes and then missed them?

I don't think that the buildings were destroyed on purpose or anything but I will eat a million hats if someone somewhere can prove that absolutely nobody in the security services or certain sections of American society knew about the fact that there was a strong chance that a plane would be used in domestic terrorism in the next few days.   

In my eyes, there is no fucking way that the suspicious option trading and number of random cancellations, coupled with the very strong rumors of Intel briefings warning of plane terror attacks in the US are all isolated rumors / conjecture. There were definitely a large number of people who knew that it would happen but maybe didn't want to cause a panic so hushed it up from the public."
4531,2,WTC,"&gt; The 'crash site' of the plane that was supposed to hit the Pentagon, and how it looked absolutely nothing like a plane crash when comparing.

You should check out some actual plane crashes. There's a great documentary series called ""Mayday - Air Crash Investigation"". There's been many crashes where there was literally nothing left of the plane."
4532,2,WTC,dont forget about the passport from one of the hijackers was found at groundzero lol
4533,2,WTC,"&gt; Wondering when will americans admit that there were a lot of shady shit around 9/11.

Unfortunately, a good amount of people find that unpatriotic, as stupid as it is."
4534,2,WTC,It sucks considering questioning the government is about as patriotic as you can get. Organized dissent is the hallmark of a healthy nation.
4535,2,WTC,"I absolutely agree with you. One side of American politics tends to really enjoy organized (and sometimes disorganized) dissent, and the other side tends to demonize it anytime it happens."
4536,2,WTC,Gotta stand with the shady corporate overlords that keep raping you. Patriotism. 
4537,2,WTC,They also replaced essential steel with low-temperature jetfuel melt-able steel.
4538,2,WTC,"They also installed C4 all around the building...

/s"
4539,2,WTC,They also painted a large target on the side of the building.
4540,2,WTC,It's a wonder Target managed to stay in business. 
4541,2,WTC,Pointing out the real conspiracy
4542,2,WTC,"We Canadians caught on quickly, had to shut that shit down. "
4543,2,WTC,They also brought enough spare parts to build a jet
4544,2,WTC,"Did you know that the same day of the crash they filled those jets with highly flammable jet fuel?

How deep does the conspiracy go?"
4545,2,WTC,They also put real people on the planes to make it seem all the more realistic.
4546,2,WTC,I heard they used four planes as fail-safes. 
4547,2,WTC,"Well, there was that one they shot down over Pa."
4548,2,WTC,They even staged thousands of people around the building to take footage!
4549,2,WTC,"There aren't thousands of recordings though only a few official ones have survived, so that's weird."
4550,2,WTC,"Not really.  It was 2001, there were no smart phones, most, if not all cell phones didn't do video.  There were pretty small numbers of people that had devices to record video with.  "
4551,2,WTC,"They even built two incredibly high skyscrapers in Manhattan for the planes to crash into... but the thing is, they built those things back in the early 70's... this was a long time in planning."
4552,2,WTC,The Romans invented concrete over 2000 years ago...this shit goes deep.
4553,2,WTC,They also planned it all in advance and tried to make it look like a terrorist attack.
4554,2,WTC,"Firstly I whole heartedly agree. It doesn't take anywhere near the amount of heat, to bend steel beams BUT what gets missed alot is that there is footage of MOLTEN steel pouring out the side of the building before it collapsed and it was found at the scene afterwards."
4555,2,WTC,Jet fuel burned at 90th floor in North Tower. How did it weaken the steel at the bottom of the tower?
4556,2,WTC,Source?
4557,2,WTC,LOL what sub do you think this is?
4558,2,WTC,it's mentioned in the linked article; not that anyone reads linked articles...
4559,2,WTC,And what is their source?
4560,2,WTC,They saw it on the Internet (?)
4561,2,WTC,How often do bomb sniffing dogs realistically stay on the property lol. That's jumping to conclusions 
4562,2,WTC,All the time. The dogs live on the property. 
4563,2,WTC,"Proof? Trained dogs like that can't be *on* 100% of the time, they'd lose their minds. Living on the property they're supposed to protect would be a bad idea."
4564,2,WTC,"They were introduced in the WTC after the 1993 bombing, IIRC."
4565,2,WTC,"Agreed, as well as increased security below which regardless of power outage would not have been circumvented unless there was a collusion.  If the were bringing in thermite and personnel they would of used the freight elevators.  Meaning theg likely had to pass bomb sniffing dogs at the gate to the basement.  Do dogs sniff out Thermite?"
4566,2,WTC,"Did it ever occur to anyone that such a massive complex like WTC is under a near-constant state of construction, repair and maintenance?"
4567,2,WTC,"ALso a full shutdown of the building for 36hours would NEVER happen.  Those places were so huge and had offices that were open 24-7.  Its possible they had to cut power for a short period for maintenance, but guaranteed they wouldve been running backup gennies. "
4568,2,WTC,"Barring a large and/or widespread problem with the power company, I'd have to agree. Buildings such as these most certainly have backups and any maintenance work of this scale is ideally done in sections. At least, that's my experience. Strange, no doubt--but doesn't mean bombs."
4569,2,WTC,"&gt;  Strange, no doubt--but doesn't mean bombs.

Is this ""36 hours of downtime"" theory new? I've not heard it. I feel like we'd have known about it if it were true."
4570,2,WTC,Guy says in the article he can't verify any power was out besides on his floor ffs
4571,2,WTC,"I haven't either. Pretty significant bit of information, no matter what you may believe. "
4572,2,WTC,"It's not significant if it's false. Giving merit to stuff like this is one of the elements that has led to fake news being taken seriously. 

Apparently the source cannot verify that the power went out in the rest of the building. He can only verify it went out on his floor. "
4573,2,WTC,"If there was an electrical work being done it would have been other than testing. This is also an unknown account by a random person who may or may not have been involved at, or could be just making this up and it's on a sketchy site. Ohh, and no other news organization has ever reported this. Jesus christ people "
4574,2,WTC,"In the 9 months leading up to 9/11, the Twin Towers had one of the largest elevator modernization projects **in the world**. Definitely not routine maintenance. "
4575,2,WTC,Get outta here with rational thinking
4576,2,WTC,"In the context of ""I'm looking for evidence that suggests explosives were planted shortly before 11.sept."" ...this stands out as interesting.

In any other context, this is not particularly unusual or interesting, regardless of whether Scott Forbes (who the hell is Scott Forbes?) says its unusual.

This is just one of those distracting points that proves nothing and can still be totally unrelated, but easily perks up the ears of those already convinced of the conspiracy.

Unlike other points that have no alternative explanation."
4577,2,WTC,"They could have failed over to their backup data center, for the planned maintenance window. "
4578,2,WTC,"I wish this was higher up.  All data centers have multiple offsite backups and fail over plans.  One site not having power for 36 hours isn't a big deal, and the vast majority of their customers wouldn't have ever known about it."
4579,2,WTC,"&gt; All data centers have multiple offsite backups and fail over plans.

Not true, not all. Probably not even the majority of data centers since most data centers that aren't owned by Google or AWS are colos.

Most people using colos don't have an offsite failover. "
4580,2,WTC,"&gt; All data centers have multiple offsite backups and fail over plans

Maybe if you're Amazon or Microsoft... Find me a co-lo that will duplicate your hardware anywhere for any price. "
4581,2,WTC,You can take your logic (and DR plans) and fuck right off!
4582,2,WTC,Just a completely worthless contribution to the conversation
4583,2,WTC,"&gt; their backup data center

That's not even a given even today, let alone in 2001. "
4584,2,WTC,"Yeah but that's why data centers are always their own buildings with multiple sources of power, back up generators, and multiple internet connections. There's 0% chance that a 5 9's primary hosting datacenter was in the WTC in the middle of NYC."
4585,2,WTC,In 2001?
4586,2,WTC,"I'm not buying this whole story in general, but yes, in 2001 we'd had data centers for forty years, and a _36 hour outage_ would have been completely and utterly unacceptable.  The whole ""five nines"" thing started out in the 1980s, FFS!

Source: me, computer programmer for 35 years."
4587,2,WTC,"Yes, even in 2001."
4588,2,WTC,"Can confirm, if a datacenter went down for 30 hours we wouldnt be hearing about this mysterious power outage from one guy 15 years later."
4589,2,WTC,I mean you would if your data tower was blown to pieces
4590,2,WTC,"Data is super serious shit every year, all the time, since forever."
4591,2,WTC,Not to every zone in a building that big 
4592,2,WTC,"Well it can't have been to the entire building for the entire time because at the time I had a script that picked up a file and put another one back every 12 hours on an ftp server located in one of the towers. 

From may to 9/11 i only had one missed shot, and that was in august 2001 when I visited their office and deliberately fucked the file up to demo the fail over."
4593,2,WTC,They just needed a [better sysadmin.](https://xkcd.com/705/)
4594,2,WTC,"Yeah, I mean, it's not like anything weird happened shortly afterwards that would warrant scrutinising the events leading up to it. "
4595,2,WTC,"Why are the most upvoted comments in /r/conspiracy threads the ones that try to downplay/distract from the main point of the post?... 

Not blaming you in particular for commenting this, because you have the right to your own opinion. Just questioning the users/bots that upvote comments that discourage being skeptical.  "
4596,2,WTC,It's because this post hit /r/all
4597,2,WTC,"Primarily because they assert sound arguments and aren't just blindly agreeing to whatever narrative is presented in an article. 

They're upvoted because not everyone who hangs out in /r/conspiracy thinks the world is controlled by lizard people who are about to send the world into a new globalist age of fascist rule by force. 

Rational people like to do their best to think rationally, so the rational thing to do is to analyze what's presented and then rationalize it.   

Edit:  The lizard people are lulling you all into a false sense of security by gilding me. 

"
4598,2,WTC,"What.

""Blindly"" would be accepting the official narrative, and ignoring the many, many holes.

No lizard people are necessary. From Operation Northwoods to the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the United States' penchant for false flags has been perpetrated by human beings as far as I know."
4599,2,WTC,You can blindly accept something against the official narrative as easily as you can blindly accept a theory that enforces it.  I was just pointing out that just because someone wrote a 9/11 anecdote doesn't mean the incident meant anything insidious 
4600,2,WTC,"You're acting as if this anecdote is the first time people have questioned the official narrative, as opposed to it being a combined reaction to a preponderance of contradictions, irregularities and outright holes in that narrative; cui bono analysis of the events; and suspicious events after the fact."
4601,2,WTC,"Nobody gilds here.  That's supporting the Man, man. If anything it makes us more suspicious of you.."
4602,2,WTC,I have frequented r/conspiracy for awhile and you barely see any people who actually genuinely believe in lizard people. Saying that about the subreddit is a very dismissive generalization.
4603,2,WTC,"lol what a joke, get off your high horse.  nice gild, super common for gold to be given out in this sub"
4604,2,WTC,Because CIA invented the term conspiracy theorists to make any real sceptic look like a loon. 
4605,2,WTC,The downvotes are from people that *are* skeptical and don't just accept the mainstream conspiracy theory.
4606,2,WTC,"Here's my question to you so called 9/11 truthers: if Bill Clinton couldn't hide a single cum stained dress, what makes you think Dubbya is secretly a highly competent evil genius who managed to pull a multi-million dollar 10,000 man operation and not a single one of the people involved had enough of a guilty conscious to come forward with the truth? If Snowden came forward with the whole NSA thing, why has there never been a Snowden for 9/11? Also, why didn't Dubbya frame an Iraqi as one of the hijackers? The war in Iraq was fought based on a bullshit reason from the beginning even if you accept that all the hijackers were Al-Queda terrorists."
4607,2,WTC,"First off, ""Dubbya"" was most likely just a useful idiot. Cheney is suspected to be the real mastermind.

Second, did it ever occur to you that the Bill Clinton scandal was created and promoted by TPTB for something he did? Pissed off the wrong people, tried to changes things too much, etc. The fact that the only evidence was a cum-stained dress that Monica saved for exactly that reason screams honeypot to me, rather than just some idiot of got caught.

Third, a 10,000 man operation is a completely made-up number. But regardless of that, are you implying that our government is incapable of performing covert operations without controlling the operatives or the information that they share with the public?

"
4608,2,WTC,"&gt; But regardless of that, are you implying that our government is incapable of performing covert operations without controlling the operatives or the information that they share with the public?

The main way you keep covert operations covert is by limiting the number of people involved and informed. You segregate information on a need-to-know basis. 

A covert operation the size of the alleged WTC controlled demolitions would drain like a leaky faucet. The number of individuals in-the-know required for such an operation would be far too large to control. 

The conspiracy that Flight 93 was shot down by the US Air Force is far more plausible because the number of people in-the-know required for the action and subsequent cover-up are very few; the pilot and his CO. Maintenance staff would realize something happened when the jet came back with one less missile, but they wouldn't ever receive confirmation."
4609,2,WTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxFYPpObtog

What about people like this? She's been speaking out, but I'd bet my house that you've never seen this seminar.

My point is, just because you don't think there are people speaking out about this, doesn't make it true. Half of the cover-up effort is preventing leaks, and the other half is addressing any of the leaks that do. Whether it be suppressing the information, discrediting it, or murdering the leaker."
4610,2,WTC,"As I said in October, before the world ended - how is it that the Dems can rig the whole world order against the working man and woman, but can't secure their email?"
4611,2,WTC,"Ignoring the first part, I think in the second part, they genuinely didn't expect to get called out for any of it.  I think those people feel safe enough/have enough dirt on people that they don't really fear legal intervention from Federal agencies.  I mean, what they did with email was beyond stupid.  It's not just that they weren't following best practices, it's that they weren't even aware of what their practices *were* or what best practices even looked like.

I think they genuinely didn't care because they didn't think anyone would call them out on it.  And honestly that makes me more suspicious.  It's likely only partisanship on the part of Republicans (which I am certainly not) that forced the hand of people to actually notice that restricted information was going places it never should have.  That's scarier to me."
4612,2,WTC,"That brings up another truther point.. The Clinton sex scandal investigation received something like 10x the funding as the WTC investigation.. they weren't meant to find out what happened on that day.

Many people have come forward, you just don't hear about them.  A quick and credible one I can think of, who wasn't directly involved in the planning of 9/11 but was quickly exposed to the truth was [4 star NATO General Wesley Clark.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw&amp;t=3s)"
4613,2,WTC,"Did you know there's a $300,000 finite model analysis being conducted, which challenges the official models released by NIST regarding the third tower collapse on 9/11?

His primary findings are discussed here at this ASCE presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKN4qilUOfs

The models will be released for peer review in ~May.

4615,2,WTC,"I saw a show talking about exactly that.  Problem is, as the show pointed out, the testing never took into consideration the jet fuel.

Could the building withstand the IMPACT of a 747 at... whatever velocity?  Yes.  Would it remain standing hours later after the jet fuel in the tanks caught fire and weakened the support structure?

That second part was never addressed.  The impact wasn't the problem."

Every single building around there had cams, for sure - but NO ONE EVER has asked for any cam footage from ANY building - and I don't even think I ever heard of it even *mentioned* as a ""WTF?"""
4649,2,WTC,"What do you think the security footage would show? Surely even if this is all a plot to install explosives into the WTC, why would the covert agents doing it show up in anything but what would look perfectly normal. 

And the other thing I don't get is why would they plant explosives into the WTC. They ran two fucking planes into the building. Why do they need to plant a bomb."
4650,2,WTC,The planes were not enough to do it alone.
4651,2,WTC,Do you realize the size of the 767? The mass and energy behind it at full throttle in a dive? Easily more powerful than a JDAM 
4652,2,WTC,Wouldn't it then just be easier to get a team of terrorists on the ground to run a truck into the base of the buildings and blow them up. I figure that'd be easier that stealing 2 planes and steering them into buildings. 
4653,2,WTC,I don't think you could bring one of these down with a truck bomb. The OKC bombing showed a lot of damage to the building but nowhere near what would be required to affect structural integrity. 
4654,2,WTC,Right a truck bomb worked in 93 didnt it? They tried that. 
4655,2,WTC,"After the 1993 bombing, they installed massive concrete pillons to stop a moving truck attack, plus bomb sniffing dogs (who were perhaps not there for some reason during the 36 hour window)"
4656,2,WTC,"My favorite is how the owner of the WTC buildings put in a ""terrorist"" clause in his insurance not 2 months before the attacks and then made a killing from it:

&gt;Just months before 9/11, the World Trade Center's lease was sold to Larry Silverstein. Silverstein took out an insurance plan that fortuitously covered terrorism. **After 9/11, Silverstein took the insurance company to court,** ***claiming he should be paid double*** **because there were 2 attacks. He won**, and was awarded $4,550,000,000.

Of course he won.  Of course he won.

That and the 3rd building... that and free fall speeds... that and the professionally cut steel at the base site... that and whatever the fuck was under the airplane's belly that hit the tower... ya know.  Just little things.  And don't even start me on the alleged ""Pentagon"" plane.  Have you seen a plane wreck?  Did you see the lawn of the Pentagon mere moments after the attack?  Where is all of the *shit* that a normal plane wreck leaves thrown all over the place?

Conspiracy theories are fun! "
4663,2,WTC,"First thing I thought too. I mean, I'm all for listening to differing theories, and I don't necessarily accept the commission report as 100% fact, but you've had a terrorist attack on a very high profile, very expensive building in the past, you put terrorism insurance on that shit when you buy it."
4664,2,WTC,"Hi, friend. I am not a believer on the WTC ""inside job"" theories, but I'd like to engage in an honest conversation with someone who is. If you don't mind, then here comes my first inquiry. One thing that I find weird and hard for the conspiracies to explain is... Al Qaeda. 
Why did Osama bin Laden and other key Al Qaeda leaders, people who were searched for sponsoring terrorism since the 80s against American targets, have released many videos throughout the years and beginning the day of the attack, claiming that they did it? The videos are not edited, he does say so in Arabic, and his own children don't contest it! His son, who is a former Al Qaeda member trained in Afghanistan later become British citizen and who always defended his father and even sued the US Government after bin Laden's death, says his father really did it and that it was even against him disagreeing on the decision.

Here are some of my points:

1) I find it too hard to believe that bin Laden, a billionaire who built his entire biography on mistrust of Americans, would sell his creed to collaborate with the American government or military on this. That the entire leadership of Al Qaeda jumps without exception on the same boat is even more unlikely.

2) Afghanistan is not a resources rich country and its then government did not try to interfere at all in the neighboring countries nor did it harbor American companies or interests in its territory (like, for example, Iraq, Iran, KSA, Lebanon did). Why would the US care about attributing the attacks to them? You won't find any soul madder than me for the whole manipulation that was the discourse to march into Iraq and that war. But if it was an inside job envisioning that second war, why not link up to Iraqis from day one?

3) It was and still is extremely problematic for geopolitical and legal factors that most of the attackers were Saudis. A lot of big fucking problems would have been avoided and lots of American and Middle-Eastern folks in power would have benefitted if the attackers turned out to be just Afghani or Iraqi. Why not do that then, if these identities are supposedly faked?

4) Even if somehow (unexplainable to me) Bin Laden and the whole AlQaeda faked their participation in the attacks, wouldn't eventually, in the years that followed in which bin Laden's family, friends, assets and life were thoroughly fucked by America wouldn't he then say ""Fuck that, I'm coming out on that shit and exposing those fuckers""? And yet, up until the very last videos and messages he recorded, he still claimed the attacks, and even promised new ones. And in many of his videos bin Laden alert the public to a lot of dirty shit the American government has done, some of it undeniably true and some of it taken from disputable sources like the ones this sub often uses too. And this same guy doesn't ever come out and record some shit exposing the biggest scandal of them all in his effort to generate mistrust of the American government and elites? I find that really weird.

Edit: for all the people saying that the way the buildings were affected point to blatant obvious purposeful manipulation of demolition, I'd like to ask you: are all the engineers over /r/AskEngineers getting paid to counter argue that too? Because [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/33tl74/how_did_the_wtc_north_tower_top_section_fall_and/?st=iykovf8f&amp;sh=d9663e13) is what usually happens whenever a 9/11 truther pops up at their sub with this kind of question."
4665,2,WTC,"Allow me to preface my response:  I am not an expert on all the goings on within the region or the various militant factions.  I also fully accept the fact that to many of these questions there is not a clear cut answer.  The CIA are good at what they do, so good that we rarely hear of their exploits.  So understanding that, I accept that the information we'll have at hand, at best, will be less than clear-cut.

1.  We do know that Osama did work with us and we armed him and his  Mujahideen when they fought against the Russians.  So we know that connection exists.  I think any relationship between Osama and the US, especially in times more recent to 2001, would have been very secretive.  If the CIA approached him and offered him a way to strike at Americans, why would he have turned it down?  It's also entirely possible that the CIA played him.  They fed him or his agents information, they exposed a weakness, fed that information to Osama, and then he took advantage of it.

2.  Good question!  From what I've read and heard, Iraq was a scape goat to get us into Afghanistan - the base of Osama and his training camps.  And also the home of the largest opium fields around.  There have been reports that the CIA has been selling the opium.  From what I recall, Afghanistan was the place we should have originally attacked, not Iraq.  Iraq only makes sense because of the oil and for Bush to correct his dad's legacy.  

3.  A great question too.  I think this is only a problem for us to understand when we assume, falsely so, that the US operates on one agenda.  Instead I think there are several entities at play within the US, vying for that power.  So while its inconvenient to have all those Saudi people, it might have also played right into the hands of people that want us to eventually ""liberate"" Saudi for ourselves.  A lot of the secret intelligence community is very, very weird, and they have their own agendas and their own masters.  All the backstabbing and such is scary, honestly.  They operate in such secrecy that few people know everything that is going on.

4.  I don't think they faked their participation in the attacks.  I think it was a mutually beneficial arrangement or Osama didn't know he was being used.  The CIA or other powers that be wanted to get us into war.  Osama wanted to do something grand to garner more support for himself.  The WTC was the mark and both parties benefited from it, be it known or unknown to Osama.  The only loser really was the American people.  Everyone else got what they wanted.  I think Osama put his people aboard those planes, and I believe they believed they were honestly doing an original attack, but they were just pawns in a much larger game.  If Osama had came out and exposed the 9/11 conspiracy, then he'd have exposed that he was in coordination with some American element, and that would have undermined his supporters trust in him.  Better to keep silent, take the beating, and retain your crown as the terrorist mastermind.

Honestly, you raise good questions and I don't have as good of answers as I'd like.  That's often the nature of conspiracy theories though, right? :)  It's also the reason I am so fascinated by conspiracy topics; they require a high level of analytical ability and to see the big picture over a long scope of time.  People who are looking for a nicely wrapped box with a bow on top of it full of evidence are going to be left wanting.  In order to really get a good idea about why 9/11 occurred, one must step back from the WTC, step back from Osama, and view the *big, big picture* -- which I believe is still happening today with Syria.  As with most things, it's seemingly all about the money:

* Libya was talking about going to an all-gold currency and getting off the USD.  The US couldn't allow them to rally other African nations behind them so we stepped in to take them out. 
* Iraq was a clean-up from G.H.W. Bush's days by his son. 
* Afghanistan had massive opium fields.
* Egypt just sort of happened with a little nudge.

Can I stop here to call people's attention to the fact that we've toppled FOUR nations in the span of about 15 years?  That should be alarming for anyone interested in a peaceful world.  But I digress.

In the year 2000, there were 7 nations without a Rothchild Central Bank:

* Afghanistan
* Iraq
* Sudan
* Libya
* Cuba
* North Korea
* Iran

In the  year 2011, there are only THREE nations without a Rothchild owned Central Bank:

* Cuba
* North Korea
* Iran

The major goal here is Iran.  [Hell, even the General Clark told us of their plan!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw)

4666,2,WTC,"Hey

First off, thanks for taking my intervention seriously and in a good spirit. I understand we are, of course, in the realm of pure speculation and hypothesis here in this discussion. One interesting thing though raised by you and a few others - and that I rarely, if ever, hear in these terms - is that the conspiratorial aspect of 9/11 is not that it was, as it's often repeated, an ""inside job"" in the lines of ""some American elite did it"" but instead that there was awareness and permission concerning it, though it wasn't orchestrated by the same people aware of it in America. It's a huge difference between ""architecting and perpetrating something"" and ""knowing about it and allowing it to happen, or even facilitate"". 

As of now, I still don't believe these theories, I don't find them compelling enough and I think most if not all of them leave more holes open than the official narrative (which can also leave some holes but can't be replaced with something even more flawed). But I appreciate your attempting at rationally tackling some of the issues brought up. You may not be right, I don't know, but at least you raise reasonable stuff.

Two side comments/critiques: 

1) ""The reason I am so fascinated by conspiracy topics is because they require a high level of analytical ability.""
To be honest with you I think one of the main reasons for why I am not fascinated with conspiracy theories is because most of the people I come across who indulge in them are more often than not very selective, gullible, scientifically and politically illiterate. Very much not the most down to earth hard core rational analytical types I know. I'm sure many are, and you seem to be, but most, or at least the most visible ones aren't. And then there is the issue of what theories to pick. Some are reasonable. Some have margin for doubt. Some are not reasonable and there is a point in which the disproportionate and overwhelming evidence should prevail. Fake moon landing and flat Earth folks come to mind, for example. This [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWy1qmMoToM) by famous debunker Captain Disillusion tackles this by some degree.

2) I think the people of Cuba is heroic in their resistance to imperialism and foreign intervention and I'm fully aware of the many ways the American-led international monetary system fucks third-world nations. And the thing about them not wanting new competitive systems in currency is pretty serious. That being said, whenever Rothchild come up I... let's put it mildly.. find it problematic. It is one of those all-times-favorite pet conspiracies that I just can't swallow. It's like Illuminati talk to me.

Anyway, thanks a lot for your points and discussion."
4667,2,WTC,"Ya, you're absolutely right.  My biggest critique of the conspiracy-community is that many seem to lead with their emotions first.  I like a good conspiracy theory as much as the next guy, but I need there to be some legitimately questionable information first.  If I can get some good information (*like skilled pilots saying that the WTC flying was extremely difficult for even a good pilot, yet we're told the hijackers were barely able to pass their flight tests*) then I can run with that.  But if it's emotion only, eh.  I leave emotion-only stuff to the SJWs. lol.

Calling it Rothchild banking might be over simplified, as it likely encompasses more than just the Rothchilds and has no doubt spread to other elements.  Its just more an easy term to use to get the vast concept across as quickly as possible.  So when I say ""Rothchild"" you immediately know I mean an international monetary systems pushed and controlled by a few powerful people, etc., stopping new currencies, toppling nations that don't accept central banking and setting up regimes that do, etc.  That's all ""Rothchild Central Banking"" to me because it spawns from our own Federal Reserve, which was Rothchild supported and inspired.  It's all about being in control of the issuance of the money and doing whatever it takes to keep that power.

I guess I just never believe anything is what it is on face value and when there is money involved, I become even more of a skeptic. :)

"
4668,2,WTC,"Thanks for engaging in this conversation with me. We maintain a few differences but I feel your attitude enriched the debate. Also, fair enough for the clarified terms."
4669,2,WTC,"&gt;Why did Osama bin Laden and other key Al Qaeda leaders, people who were searched for sponsoring terrorism since the 80s against American targets, have released many videos throughout the years and beginning the day of the attack, claiming that they did it

That's simply not true.  Bin Laden denied being behind the attacks for several years and the *only* time he ""admitted"" to it was in a video that has been described by a Bin Laden expert and professor at Duke University as ""a hoax.""  Many Bin Laden videos are fake, and the *one* in which he takes credit is almost certainly fake.

Why would you pull off the most successful terrorist attack in history, and then not only not take credit, but straight up deny it was you?

Bin Laden said he doesn't hit soft targets, he's known for attacking embassies and military bases."
4670,2,WTC,"
Every country is. The point is that it isn't nearly as much rich as a lot of other neighboring and not so neighboring countries that could have easily been attributed the attacks to. Also, could you give a more credible resource on those numbers? On a final note, do you know what American companies are exploring these mines?"
4671,2,WTC,"No one thinks the attacks were faked. Rather that there were those in the US that knew about them, let them happen, and executed a plan to embellish them to create a false flag large enough to accomplish policy that would never fly otherwise.

If the towers don't come down, the attack would have been out of the news cycle in a month.

Then you have feature creep... I have some records I want to get rid of, mind also taking out a wing of the Pentagon and building 7?

I remain skeptical, but it's far from unreasonable."
4672,2,WTC,"Can I take a stab at it? First, I must say it's been a while so forgive me if I'm a bit off.

1) I am not aware of any instance where Osama Bin Laden claimed ownership as the mastermind of 9/11. Assuming he did though, he wouldn't need to collaborate with the US. The US would simply need to **allow** his, or any plan to come to fruition. 

2) I'm not sure of the motivation to go into Afghanistan but they are very rich in one resource... [Post 9/11 Afghanistan: Opium Cultivation, Production Increases Nearly 20-Fold](http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/09/11/post-911-afghanistan-opium-cultivation-production-increases-nearly-20-fold/)

3) This goes back to the ""allow it to happen"" theory. i.e. the US hears chatter. Doesn't stop the attack. Takes steps to make sure the attack would be successful... profit

4) ""he still claimed the attacks"" can you prove this? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just unaware of it's authenticity. Also, there is some good evidence that some of the videos were faked."

That being said, I agree with most of your points.  Especially WTC 7 &amp; The pentagon are really sketchy.  I really don't know what happened that day, but The official story ain't it."

4679,2,WTC,"That sounds credible. I'd think that trucks arrived there every night. Big building, lot's of traffic going in and out. Just imagine the amount of toilet paper used in those bathrooms, to get an idea. Thats at least a truck a week. Office supplies, cleaning material, replacement lightbulbs. Then you have food that has to be delivered daily etc. Makes sense to handle that during night time, when there is fewer people around."

4691,2,WTC,"to the shill askin why those 3 buildings needed to be demolished:

silverstein just needed those 3 demolished as they were full of asbestos and demolishing them a legal way is expensive plus doesn't get him his insurance money."
4692,2,WTC,"The estimate to get rid of the asbestos was more than the buildings value. Already knowing that, Silverstein bought the building."

4701,2,WTC,"If there were undeniable photographic, video, audio and written evidence of the US CIA &amp; President being responsible for planning 9/11 what exactly would the American people's responses be the very next day? "
4702,2,WTC,"The same. There is undeniable proof. Watch the videos. You can clearly see explosions going down the side of the towers and building 7. In one video before the collapse a man is literally blown out a window by an explosion that doesn't effect any other windows. There is video evidence of explosions in the basement. Torn bodies and concrete rubble. It's all online. Bloody pools in the basement. Torn bodies and rubble all point to a massive series of planned explosions. Some people above the explosions had ankles broken when the floor surged upwards. We had an explosion at work inside a boat that was being worked on and the guys on the top deck were thrown off. One guy had an ankle broken in the exact same manner. Then it hit me, this was an explosion BELOW these witnesses and that's what they said. And yet, the public ignores eye witness accounts. "

4721,2,WTC,Except Building 7
4722,2,WTC,"Structural engineers who designed the Twin Towers carried out studies in the mid-1960s to determine how the buildings would fare if hit by large jetliners. In all cases the studies concluded that **the Towers would survive the impacts and fires caused by the jetliners**

Contrary to widely promoted misconceptions, the Boeing 767-200s used on 9/11/01 were only slightly larger than 707s and DC 8s, the types of jetliners whose impacts the World Trade Center's designers anticipated

[FEMA's Report shows the sizes of a 707 and a 767 relative to the footprint of a WTC tower.](http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/docs/aircraftcomparison.gif)  Flight 11 and Flight 175 were Boeing 767-200s. Although a 767-200 has a slightly wider body than a 707, the two models are very similar in overall size, weight and fuel capacity

property| Boeing 707-320| Boeing 767-200
---|---|----
fuel capacity| 23,000 gallons| 23,980 gallons
max takeoff weight| 328,060 lbs| 395,000 lbs
empty weight| 137,562 lbs| 179,080 lbs
wingspan| 145.75 ft| 156.08 ft
wing area| 3010 ft^2| 3050 ft^2
length| 152.92 ft| 159.17 ft
cruise speed| 607 mph| 530 mph

Given the differences in cruise speeds, a 707 in normal flight would actually have more kinetic energy than a 767, despite the slightly smaller size. Note the similar fuel capacities of both aircraft. The 767s used on September 11th were estimated to be carrying about 10,000 gallons of fuel each at the time of impact, only about 40% of the capacity of a 707

**Statements by Engineers**

 John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.

&gt;[Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel \(from the airplane\) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed, ... The building structure would still be there](http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930227&amp;slug=1687698)

 A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11

&gt;[The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner \(Boeing 707DC 8\) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact, page 131](http://www.amazon.com/City-Sky-World-Trade-Center/dp/0805076913)

4725,2,WTC,Articles like these need more daylight. 
4726,2,WTC,"I imagine the amount of people required to cover up something like this is enormous. That many people could never keep a secret. 

Edit: I am willing to concede that secrets have been kept by large groups of people but I think something like the Manhattan project is a poor comparison in this case. Covering up the development of a weapon (even a WMD) is nothing like covering up the premeditated murder of 3,000 US civilians on US soil. "
4727,2,WTC,"Just to chime in, I don't have all the answers, none of us do. I will just offer my opinion, right or wrong, and that would be that the Manhattan Project struck great interest with Soviets. Their intelligence obviously knew that the USA was on some sort of fast-track to something big, but what? It was a new type of technology/weapon. A false-flag operation (Yes, I'm using the coined-phrase, sue me) like 9/11 would not be in Russia's interests. Gaining social control of a population is required to control it, and I don't think Russia would argue with the US attempting to systematically control what little values and prosperity, and unity, their citizens had left. I just don't believe that would be of interest.

However, a project of this size, having no one affirmative ""leak"", is highly speculative."
4728,2,WTC,"and 9/11 has had plenty of whistleblowers as well.  here are just a handful:

&gt; Barry Jennings was an important eyewitness to the events of 9/11. At the time, he was the Deputy Director of the Emergency Services Department for the New York City Housing Authority. Together with Michael Hess, the New York City Corporation Counsel (an associate of Rudy Giuliani), he was rescued from WTC Building 7 before it collapsed at 5:20 p.m. On several occasions, Jennings stated that an explosion trapped them in WTC Building 7 (before the collapses of WTC 1 &amp; 2) and that explosions occurred throughout the building until they were saved after attracting the attention of a team of firefighters through a broken 8th floor window.

&gt; J. Michael Springmann was the former head of the American visa bureau in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the Reagan and former Bush administrations, from September 1987 through March 1989.[1] While stationed in Saudi Arabia, Springmann was ""ordered by high level State Dept officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants"". Springmann states that these applicants were terrorist recruits of Osama Bin Laden, who were being sent to the United States in order to obtain training from the C.I.A.

&gt; Sibel Edmonds - In the wake of 9/11, Sibel Edmonds heeded the FBIs call for Middle Eastern language experts to support their counterterrorism unit. Fluent in Turkish and Azerbaijani and conversational in Farsi, she joined the FBI as a translator on September 15, 2001. She soon discovered gross negligence and criminal conspiracy in the FBI and State Department, including deliberately mistranslated documents in the Bureaus possession before 9/11 that contained information about the attacks, nuclear spies being facilitated by top government officials and foreign operatives who were taken in for questioning after 9/11 being released because they were connected to those spy rings. A 2005 report from the Office of the Inspector General determined that none of Edmonds allegations can be refuted. 

&gt; Coleen Rowley - When the so-called 20th hijacker Zaccharias Moussaoui was detained on August 15th, 2001, agents in the Minneapolis FBI field office immediately sought a criminal warrant to search his belongings. Management at the FBI dealing with the request threw up numerous obstacles to the agents, and even withheld information from them, including the now-infamous Phoenix Memo written by an agent in Arizona warning of terrorists training in flight schools for a possible upcoming attack. The request was denied and agents were prevented from searching Moussaouis laptop, which contained information that would have tipped the FBI off to the 9/11 plot.

&gt; Robert Wright - In the 1990s, Special Agent Robert Wright of the FBIs Chicago field office spearheaded an investigation into terrorist financing codenamed Vulgar Betrayal. The investigation uncovered information about Yassin Al-Qadi, a terrorist financier who would go on to be designated a global terrorist financier by the U.S. treasury in the wake of 9/11. Vulgar Betrayal led to information about the African embassy bombings in 1998 and resulted in the seizure of $1.4 million of terrorist financing. Despite the investigations remarkable success, however, Wright was taken off of Vulgar Betrayal in 1999 and reduced to a paper pusher.

&gt; Indira Singh - As a risk management consultant for J.P. Morgan in 2001, Indira Singh was tasked with implementing the next generation of risk management software for the firm. Working for one of the largest financial institutions in the world, Singh wanted to choose a reputable software vendor for the task, one with a proven track record of working with the sensitive information of important clients. She solicited a presentation from Ptech, an enterprise architecture software firm whose clients included some of the most sensitive departments in the U.S. government, including the FBI, the Department of Defense, the Treasury, the IRS, the US Navy and the White House. After performing due diligence on the company, Singh discovered that it had been started in part by funds from Yassin Al-Qadi (the same Specially Designated Global Terrorist that Robert Wrights investigation had been focused on). She discovered many other disturbing links between Ptech officers and suspected terrorist organizations. Ptech had been conducting tests on the interoperability of FAA and NORAD computer systems in the event of an emergency on the morning of 9/11. When she tried to bring this information to the FBI in Boston she was told by one agent that she was in a better position to investigate the case than the Bureau was.

&gt; Emad Salem (1993 WTC bombing whistleblower): During his time as an FBI informant, Salem recorded hours of telephone conversations with his FBI handlers. In tapes made after the bombings, Salem alleged that an unnamed FBI supervisor knew about the bombing plot, but declined to move forward on a plan that would have used a ""phony powder"" to fool the conspirators into believing that they were working with genuine explosives. Federal authorities denied Salem's view of events and the New York Times concluded that the tapes ""do not make clear the extent to which Federal authorities knew that there was a plan to bomb the World Trade Center, merely that they knew that a bombing of some sort was being discussed.

The digital age has done it's trick on 9/11 like anything else. It's a huge conspiracy because of all the questions, accounts, and breadcrumbs that have come from it, and this article is just another account coming to the surface.

4736,2,WTC,"Yes and no confessions in the 16 years since. 

Not a single anon in 4chan. Not a peep. 

Those guys must really have zero regrets, huh?"
4737,2,WTC,"Not necessarily. That is a very common assumption. But just for arguments sake, let's say it was in fact an inside job organized by a group of individuals with a lot of influence, connections and authority.  Now take for example the FAA and NORAD angle.  If a higher ranking officer gives a command, realistically how many lower ranking officers will question him/her on it, or refuse to do it?  The pervasive mentality is that a good soldier obeys orders.  So although it may take quite a number of people to be involved, it does NOT inherently mean that a lot of people have to be conscious of their complicity.  I would imagine it to be a pyramid of organization.  At the very top you have a smaller group of people who know everything and are the organizers, beneath them a smaller group who know most of plan but are unaware of certain details. Beneath them a group who knows something is going to happen but don't know exactly what. Beneath them a larger group of individuals who are simply doing their job and are not privy enough to details to suspect any wrong doing.   

And if you look at nearly any large scale complicity you will find this same pattern.  "
4738,2,WTC,"Let's say a bunch of lower ranks were ordered to do X inside the WTC. Wouldn't it be strange and probably be mentioned that they were there just before the towers came down? Yeah, someone would say something. We have whistleblowers uncovering lesser things."

Hopefully one day you'll wake up before you can't. 
"
4741,2,WTC,Alternative statistics huh? That's a new one.
4742,2,WTC,"Simple physics disproves these three buildings collapsed due to natural results of airplane collisions.

The top 20 floors of either WTC 1 &amp; 2 would not be able to **pulverize to dust** the remaining 80 floors of perfectly healthy steel structure and WTC 7 could not have most of it's healthy steel structure **pulverized to dust** from a collapse started by office fires from upper floors.

Simple Newtonian physics taught in public high schools in America pokes massive holes in the NIST models.

Most people who believe the official narrative are ignorant to many, if not most of the facts surrounding the events.  My father thought the buildings collapsed the instant the planes hit them.  I don't think most people really want to know all the facts, as it is disturbing to learn about pain, suffering, and destruction.

People don't want to believe that these were controlled demolitions because of the nefarious implications, but only a handful of people needed to actually know about the demolitions and there was more than enough time to rig the towers secretively with the huge elevator upgrades that occurred in buildings 1 and 2. 

Don't forget WTC 1 and 2 were absolutely jam packed with old asbestos, which would have required hundreds of millions of dollars to replace.  So there is even more motive to demolish the properties beyond an excuse for war in the Middle East.

As far as planes, actual planes hit WTC 1 and 2.  There's too many witnesses and video to argue against this.  A third plane was likely **shot down with a missile** in Pennsylvania (due to lack of wreckage of what you would expect from a normal crash and several eye witnesses reporting hearing missiles and even one witness saying she saw what is described to be a smaller drone plane in the direct region where the plane went down) and the plane which hit the Pentagon was not the same size as the commercial flight the official report claimed.  It was likely a drone craft, as the flight path was nearly impossible for even a seasoned pilot to perform and the light posts in the parking lot which were damaged indicate a much smaller wingspan.  Not to mention the damage to the Pentagon was inconsistent with the size of the ""hijacked"" plane they claimed struck it, mainly due to the impact profile in the building and the lack of huge jet engine core wreckage.

It is easy to see how people can confuse the facts about these planes, as the convenient lack of black boxes and audio boxes leave few facts to study.  The only event that likely involved a ""missile"" was in Pennsylvania.

4782,2,WTC,"Larry Silverstein was the owner of the lease for the WTC at the time. When he purchased the lease he was told that it was a poor investment due to the towers failing to meet certain modern safety standards, and that it would be cheaper to demolish them than retrofit them to meet these standards. He chose to ignore all logical advice from many advisors and consultants.

There were unidentified workers entering and exiting the inner-workings of the towers on a daily basis for a couple years retrofitting structural components within the towers.

Keep in mind that Silverstein made a massive profit from the insurance claim when they fell. 

There is a massive laundry list of other dubious facts that I could mention about that day but this seems the most relevant to this thread.

Also, after the first plane hit and before the collapse there were people emerging from the tower covered in dust and injured, the reporters asked what floor they were on and they replied that they were underground... they said there were explosions in the underground levels of the building.

Keep in mind these towers were specifically designed to take an impact like this, and have the levels above the impact collapse while they begin to pancake down on undamaged levels below until they slow to a halt, avoiding a collapse. Instead, both towers fell at a free fall rate as if there was no resistance beneath it. The NIST reported that this wasn't a concern to their investigation...muh narrative! "
